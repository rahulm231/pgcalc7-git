		<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been said before, but merits repeating: Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. The CBO’s latest economic predictions highlighting America’s rising federal deficit underscores this point. The Wall Street Journal notes: The Congressional Budget Office said the federal budget deficit would total $804 billion this year, 43% higher than it had projected last summer, and exceed $1 trillion a year starting in 2020. The deficit was $665 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Opponents of tax reform are quick to blame the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In reality, they could not be further from the truth. Historically, following the Kennedy, Reagan and Bush tax cuts, the economy showed strong economic growth, which led to higher federal revenues over time. A report from Americans from Prosperity and Freedom Partners highlights the trend of tax cuts spurring economic growth over the years: In the 10 years following the Kennedy tax cut (proposed by JFK in 1962 and enacted in early 1964, just months after Dallas), federal tax receipts increased by $283 billion. The decade following the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 (fully phased-in by 1983), revenue rose by $400 billion. In the 10 years after the Bush tax cuts, tax receipts [&#8230;]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been said before, but merits repeating: Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-fiscal-stimulus-will-widen-budget-deficits-boost-growth-in-coming-years-1523297293">CBO’s latest economic predictions</a> highlighting America’s rising federal deficit underscores this point.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-fiscal-stimulus-will-widen-budget-deficits-boost-growth-in-coming-years-1523297293">notes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Congressional Budget Office said the federal budget deficit would total $804 billion this year, 43% higher than it had projected last summer, and exceed $1 trillion a year starting in 2020. The deficit was $665 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Opponents of tax reform are quick to blame the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In reality, they could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Historically, following the Kennedy, Reagan and Bush tax cuts, the <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/know-history-tax-cuts-increased-economic-growth-years/">economy showed strong economic growth, which led to higher federal revenues over time</a>.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/know-history-tax-cuts-increased-economic-growth-years/"> report</a> from Americans from Prosperity and Freedom Partners highlights the trend of tax cuts spurring economic growth over the years:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In the 10 years following the Kennedy tax cut (proposed by JFK in 1962 and enacted in early 1964, just months after Dallas), federal tax receipts increased by $283 billion. The decade following the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 (fully phased-in by 1983), revenue rose by $400 billion. In the 10 years after the Bush tax cuts, tax receipts climbed by $227 billion.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than blame tax cuts, which have a proven track record of fueling economic growth and increasing federal revenue, lawmakers in Washington should take a hard look at their own wasteful spending habits.</p>
<h4><strong>Drivers of the Debt</strong></h4>
<p>America’s deficit is rooted in overspending by Washington.</p>
<p>An obvious recent example is the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, which significantly boosted federal spending.</p>
<p>Moreover, Washington has also allowed spending on entitlement programs to spiral out of control. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare already account for two-thirds of federal spending.</p>
<p>As the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cbo-fiscal-stimulus-will-widen-budget-deficits-boost-growth-in-coming-years-1523297293">describes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Even before the recent flurry of fiscal stimulus, the CBO expected deficits would widen over the coming years as revenues failed to keep up with outlays including spending on major social programs such as Social Security and Medicare as the population ages.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. population ages, more Americans will find themselves dependent on these programs while the portion of taxpayers paying for these programs continues to decline.</p>
<h4><strong>An Unsustainable Path</strong></h4>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-20-of-americans-will-pay-87-of-income-tax-1523007001">reports</a> that in 2018, the top 20 percent of American income-earners will pay 87 percent of all federal income tax revenue – up from 84 percent last year.</p>
<p>Even while being able to keep more of their hard-earned money thanks to the tax cuts, they will pay an even greater share of the overall burden.</p>
<p>As the size of entitlement programs continue to expand, so will the cost burden on taxpayers, especially those in higher tax brackets.</p>
<p>And as the code continues to get more progressive, fewer and fewer Americans will be responsible for the brunt of the funding for programs that more and more Americans depend on – making it increasingly difficult to enact reforms.</p>
<p>Entitlements are on fiscally unsustainable path, and Congress’ reluctance to address the issue only kicks the can further down the road for future generations and a smaller share of Americans to contend with.</p>
<h4><strong>Time for Solutions</strong></h4>
<p>It’s time for Congress to put current and future taxpayers first by reining in federal spending.</p>
<p>One step in the right direction would be to use <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/rediscovering-rescissions/">rescissions</a>, or a process to rein in federal spending from last month’s $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill.</p>
<p>This process has been tried and tested in the past. Since 1974, presidents have proposed 1178 recessions, 461 of which Congress has agreed to, which has saved American taxpayers a total of $25 billion over the years.</p>
<p>Enacting rescissions would be a good first step towards reducing federal spending and putting America back on a sustainable path.</p>
<p>However, rescissions alone are not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>If lawmakers continue spending on autopilot and ignore the <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">growing debt</a>, the federal budget deficit is<a href="https://www.federalbudgetinpictures.com/unsustainable-budget-deficits/">projected to be 8.8 percent of our GDP by 2046</a> and future generations of Americans will be in trouble.</p>
<p>If left unchecked, federal spending will lead ordinary Americans to face devastating tax hikes, cuts to benefits, and eventual cuts to other essential programs. For example, interest on the debt alone is on track to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/interest-on-debt-to-eclipse-defense-spending-within-five-years">eclipse all defense spending</a> within the next five years.</p>
<p>To truly address America’s crushing deficit, Congress must enact meaningful reforms to make unsustainable entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare fiscally solvent again.</p>
<p>By pursuing serious reforms to cut federal spending and eliminate the federal deficit, Congressional leaders can put America back on a fiscally sustainable path and prove to taxpayers that they really do have the best interests of the American people in mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let the countdown begin!</p>
<p>We’re just a few days out from Tax Day on April 17, when we’ll say goodbye to our outdated, complex and burdensome tax system and hello to a simpler, fairer and more efficient new tax code!</p>
<p>Check out these five positive changes that all Americans will see next year thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:</p>
<h4>Say Goodbye to Uncompetitive Corporate Rates</h4>
<p>Did you know that America has had the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world for years?</p>
<p>At nearly 39 percent, our country’s cumbersome corporate tax rate has stifled growth and penalized U.S. investments, pushing American companies – and jobs – overseas.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we won’t have to deal with uncompetitive corporate rates for very much longer! Under the new tax code, Americans can say hello to a 21 percent corporate tax rate, which will spur job growth and business investment in the United States.</p>
<h4>Say Goodbye to Loopholes and Carve Outs</h4>
<p>Americans can say goodbye to a number of loopholes and carve outs—in the old code, these handouts added up to more than $1 trillion a year.</p>
<p>Instead, say hello to the biggest effort in decades to create a simpler, fairer tax code that begins to put the American people first, ahead of special interests.</p>
<h4>Say Goodbye to Punishing Tax Rates</h4>
<p>Sick of outrageously high tax rates?</p>
<p>No worries! Thanks to tax reform, you can say goodbye to the old high tax rates that have fed Washington’s spending addiction for years.</p>
<p>Instead, get ready to say hello to lower rates at every income bracket. The new tax code will nearly double the “standard deduction” (that’s the money taxed at 0 percent!), allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks!</p>
<h4>Say Goodbye to 8.9 Billion Hours of Compliance</h4>
<p>In previous years, Americans have spent 8.9 billion hours complying with the old tax code.</p>
<p>Now, you can say goodbye to all that wasted time and say hello to a simpler tax filing process, which will save time and resources next time you file federal taxes.</p>
<h4>Say Goodbye to Obamacare&#8217;s Individual Mandate</h4>
<p>A key facet of Obamacare is going away!</p>
<p>Say goodbye to Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty which has forced Americans to buy insurance or pay a tax, amounting to $695 per adult and $347.5 per child for 2017.</p>
<p>Instead, say hello to keeping more of your money and enjoying more health care freedom, without the fear of being punished for not buying Obamacare.</p>
<p>These changes are a great start to making America’s tax code simpler, fairer and easier to understand, all while helping more Americans keep more of what they earn.</p>
<p>To learn more about the American Pay Raise and how America’s new tax code will increase economic growth and provide new opportunities, higher wages and more jobs for Americans, check out <a href="http://www.americanpayraise.com/">www.AmericanPayRaise.com</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve made great progress, but our work isn’t over yet! Going forward, AFP activists must continue our efforts to protect the benefits of tax reform and make them permanent.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>By now you’ve heard millions of Americans are benefitting from tax reform. Hundreds of companies have given out bonuses, pay raises or other benefits as a direct result of the reforms Congress passed last December. But how exactly is that extra money benefitting these hard-working Americans? If you ask employees at Southwest Airlines, there’s a whole lot of different ways that money is helping. That was a topic of discussion when Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady visited the Southwest Airlines headquarters on Monday. “Tax reform was huge for our country, but it was very, very meaningful for Southwest Airlines,” said Southwest CEO Gary Kelly. “We were able to put those savings to work almost instantly.” That reform allowed Southwest to contribute an additional $5 million in charitable giving, and offer $1,000 bonuses to every single full-time and part-time employee. Some of the many things employees said they’ve spent their tax reform bonuses on include: Buying a new washer and dryer; Investing in their children’s college education; Putting it toward flight training; And donating it to a ministry to feed people in Kenya.

<p>But how exactly is that extra money benefitting these hard-working Americans? If you ask employees at Southwest Airlines, there’s a whole lot of different ways that money is helping.</p>
<p>That was a topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJovIJYo_Os">discussion</a> when Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady visited the Southwest Airlines headquarters on Monday.</p>
<p>“Tax reform was huge for our country, but it was very, very meaningful for Southwest Airlines,” said Southwest CEO Gary Kelly. “We were able to put those savings to work almost instantly.”</p>
<p>That reform allowed Southwest to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/03/news/companies/american-southwest-tax-reform-bonuses/index.html">contribute</a> an additional $5 million in charitable giving, and offer $1,000 bonuses to every single full-time and part-time employee. Some of the many things employees said they’ve spent their tax reform bonuses on <a href="https://twitter.com/AshLeeStrong/status/980915658547499009">include</a>:</p>

<li>Buying a new washer and dryer;</li>
<li>Investing in their children’s college education;</li>
<li>Putting it toward flight training;</li>
<li>And donating it to a ministry to feed people in Kenya.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chairman Brady stressed that this new tax code encourages companies to bring money back to America and invest in “new facilities, more jobs, and investing in both their workers and technology … this new tax code, for the first time in 30 years, is going to allow those companies to make that investment here in America.”</p>
<p>Speaker Ryan added that the tax code has led to “more jobs, higher wages, more American investment.”</p>
<p>While tax reform was a huge win, there’s still work to be done.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, Congress passed federal tax reform, overhauling the old tax code. That’s good news for American businesses and families, but bad news for lawmakers who opposed fixing our rigged tax system. Now that federal tax reform has gone into effect, we can say goodbye to a lot of hurtful tax policies. Here’s five things you won’t miss about our old, broken tax code. 1. Uncompetitive Tax Rates Before federal tax reform, American businesses faced the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. The 39 percent rate wasn’t just expensive, it penalized investment in American companies, pushed jobs overseas and stifled economic growth. The new tax code makes companies competitive in today’s global economy by cutting the rate to 21 percent, encouraging businesses to invest and create jobs in America. 2. Loopholes and Carve Outs Before tax reform, the federal tax code was packed with special interest deals that added up to more than $1 trillion every year. Loopholes, carve-outs and countless other additions created a complicated mess and rigged the tax code to help the well-connected at the expense of everyday Americans. The recent tax reform helped do away with many of these loopholes, creating a fairer, simpler tax [&#8230;]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, Congress passed federal tax reform, overhauling the old tax code. That’s good news for American businesses and families, but bad news for lawmakers who opposed fixing our rigged tax system.</p>
<p>Now that federal tax reform has gone into effect, we can say goodbye to a lot of hurtful tax policies.</p>
<p>Here’s five things you won’t miss about our old, broken tax code.</p>
<h4>1. Uncompetitive Tax Rates</h4>
<p>Before federal tax reform, American businesses faced the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. The 39 percent rate wasn’t just expensive, it penalized investment in American companies, pushed jobs overseas and stifled economic growth.</p>
<p>The new tax code makes companies competitive in today’s global economy by cutting the rate to 21 percent, encouraging businesses to invest and create jobs in America.</p>
<h4>2. Loopholes and Carve Outs</h4>
<p>Before tax reform, the federal tax code was packed with special interest deals that added up to more than $1 trillion every year. Loopholes, carve-outs and countless other additions created a complicated mess and rigged the tax code to help the well-connected at the expense of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>The recent tax reform helped do away with many of these loopholes, creating a fairer, simpler tax system. It’s a good start, but there’s still plenty lawmakers can do to end special interest deals hiding in the tax code.</p>
<h4>3. Punishing Tax Rates</h4>
<p>The old tax rates took too much money out of hardworking Americans’ pockets. They kept families from saving for their dreams, building a better life or making ends meet. These high rates helped feed lawmakers’ rampant spending and paid for special interest handouts.</p>
<p>The new lower tax rates allow families to keep more of their hard-earned money, an average of more than $2,000 for a family of four.</p>
<h4>4. Those Tax Headaches</h4>
<p>There are few things people hate more than filing their taxes. The impending sense of dread that starts at the beginning of tax season, the desperate scramble to find countless documents, the headache-inducing confusion and frustration. It took an army of full-time staffers, countless dollars and nearly 9 billion hours to comply with the old tax code each year.</p>
<p>The new tax code removes much of this complexity and makes it easier for families, small businesses and other Americans to comply with their taxes each year. There’s still some work to do on this, but the reforms will certainly cut down on Tax Day headaches for countless Americans!</p>
<h4>5. The Individual Mandate</h4>
<p>Under the old tax code, families were forced to buy insurance or pay an expensive tax that cost nearly $700 dollars for each adult. The individual mandate severely limited Americans’ health care freedom. With tax reform families will be free to make more of their own health care decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://americansforprosperity.ivolunteers.com/ContactOfficials/Tell-Congress-Protect-the-American-Pay-Raise">If you’re glad these bad policies are gone, tell the lawmakers who opposed tax reform it’s time to get on board and start building on the overhaul’s successes by clicking here.</a></p>

When teams take the field for Opening Day this year, many of them will be playing on the taxpayers’ dime—literally. For decades now, lawmakers at every level of government have been forking over millions of hardworking residents’ money to build stadiums for billionaire team owners.

<p>When teams take the field for Opening Day this year, many of them will be playing on the taxpayers’ dime—literally. For decades now, lawmakers at every level of government have been forking over millions of hardworking residents’ money to build stadiums for billionaire team owners.</p>
<p>The amount of tax money lawmakers eagerly fork over to keep teams happy can be staggering. The Yankees, for example, should consider themselves the luckiest team alive, considering the amount of taxpayer money they raked in to help build their new stadium. The <a href="http://www.fieldofschemes.com/news/archives/2009/01/3496_nyc_baseball_st.html">$1.2 billion</a> in government handouts and tax breaks they got should be the shame of the Yankees.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the Miami Marlins have hit the grand slam of corporate welfare deals. Their stadium has cost taxpayers <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-12-17/news/fl-readers-view-marlins-20121217_1_stadiums-end-era-fire-sale">a cool $2.4 billion</a> in corporate welfare over the past four decades. A tab like that should have Miami taxpayers shouting, “You’re killing me, Smalls!”</p>
<p>Taxpayer-subsidized ballparks aren’t limited to the east coast. Baseball teams across the country, including the Rangers, Phillies, Brewers and Padres, got hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to build their stadiums.</p>
<p>Taxpayer funding of stadiums isn’t limited to the big leagues either. Floridians and Arizonans have been stuck with the bill for spring training stadiums, and even <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/afp-va-applauds-pwc-residents-fight-taxpayer-subsidized-stadium/">minor league teams</a> throughout the country are hitting up local lawmakers for new ballparks.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are eager to foot the bill for ballparks because they mistakenly believe if they build it, benefits will come. But the scouting report on stadium subsidies isn’t good.</p>
<p><a href="https://fee.org/articles/corporate-welfare-is-spreading-to-the-minors/">Countless studies show</a> stadium subsidies strike out more often than they knock it out of the park. The reality is that big, taxpayer-funded bets on stadiums just don’t pay out.</p>
<p>Every dollar spent on subsidizing stadiums for wealthy teams is a dollar that can’t be spent on schools, roads, public safety and more. Instead of using taxpayer money to keep billionaire team owners happy, lawmakers need to start being responsible with their constituents’ money.</p>
<p><a href="https://americansforprosperity.ivolunteers.com/ContactOfficials/Tell-Lawmakers-No-Taxpayer-Money-for-Sports-Stadiums">Tell lawmakers</a> it’s time to throw stadium subsidies out of the game.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Today the House voted to pass a pork-laden $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill. While that&#8217;s bad news, one piece of good news is that the bill doesn&#8217;t include any money for Obamacare bailouts. Meant to prop up Obamacare and its skyrocketing premiums, these proposals – including reinsurance and cost-sharing reduction payments – are nothing more than taxpayer-funded handouts to private health insurance companies. That&#8217;s billions out of your pocket now boosting the bottom lines of insurance companies. Proponents of these subsidies argue that without them, health care premiums will spike. This isn&#8217;t true. There&#8217;s a reason lawmakers were right to keep these payments out of the omnibus, and should continue to oppose them in any future spending bills. Bailing Out Health Care Insurers at Taxpayers&#8217; Expense Won&#8217;t Work Throwing money at insurers has a history of failing to lower prices. The Congressional Budget Office reports that in 2016 alone, lawmakers gave billions in health care subsidies related to the Affordable Care Act, including, $12 billion in risk adjustment and reinsurance payments. $1 billion in marketplace grants to states. $32 billion in premium tax credit payments. $7 billion illegally in cost-sharing reduction payments never appropriated by Congress.

<h4>Bailing Out Health Care Insurers at Taxpayers&#8217; Expense Won&#8217;t Work</h4>
<p>Throwing money at insurers has a history of failing to lower prices. The Congressional Budget Office reports that in 2016 alone, lawmakers gave billions in health care subsidies related to the Affordable Care Act, including,</p>
<ul>
<li>$12 billion in risk adjustment and reinsurance payments.</li>
<li>$1 billion in marketplace grants to states.</li>
<li>$32 billion in premium tax credit payments.</li>
<li>$7 billion illegally in cost-sharing reduction payments never appropriated by Congress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet premiums have skyrocketed in the years since. Propping up health insurance companies won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Instead, Congress should introduce more competition and choice into the health care marketplace.</p>
<h4>Bring More Freedom, Increased Choice into the Health Care Market</h4>
<p>One way lawmakers can help increase freedom and lower health care costs is by extending short-term plans.</p>
<p>Doing so could reduce prices by 75 percent, all without putting an additional burden on taxpayers. <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/06/short-term-health-insurance-length/">According to one health care executive</a>, &#8220;the average monthly family premium for short-term health plans in 2017 was $267, about one-quarter the price of an ACA plan.&#8221; The White House has proposed such an extension, and legislation <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/afp-urges-congress-to-push-back-against-obamacare-bailouts/">introduced</a> by Sen. John Barrasso could codify it into law.</p>
<p>Millions of patients need lower health care costs. Spending billions of taxpayer dollars on insurance company handouts won&#8217;t provide a workable solution. Congress should instead extend short-term insurance plans and make them renewable. Tell Congress:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Congress is set to vote on a trillion-dollar omnibus spending bill that could potentially include several troubling provisions that AFP has consistently opposed.</p>
<p>Lawmakers should reject any attempt to include such provisions as an Obamacare bailout for health insurance companies, an online sales tax and any tax &#8220;extender&#8221; carve-outs that would undermine the benefits hard-working Americans are seeing as the result of historic tax reform.</p>
<h4>Oppose Obamacare Bailouts for Insurers</h4>
<p>Congress needs to keep any Obamacare spending bills out of the omnibus. That includes reinsurance payments and cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which, in truth, amount to nothing more than taxpayer bailouts of insurance companies.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, lawmakers are hoping to slip these payments into the omnibus under the guise of a budget gimmick that would hide the multi-billion-dollar price tag of these subsidies.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s billions of taxpayer dollars padding the profits insurance companies instead of lowering health care costs for patients by dismantling the structure of Obamacare that&#8217;s been driving up costs.</p>
<p><strong>What Congress should do instead:</strong> Extend short-term plans that could end up being as little as one-quarter of the cost of current exchange plans. The Administration has submitted a rule to expand short-term plans, but Congress should codify it into law, and better yet, make these short-term plans renewable.</p>
<p>Congress could also repeal Obamacare&#8217;s rules and regulations that drive up the cost of insurance.</p>
<p>We need to give patients more affordable options that better meet their needs. Throwing taxpayer money at insurance companies via cost-sharing reduction payments and other bad Obamacare spending bills won&#8217;t do that.</p>
<h4>Oppose an Online Sales Tax</h4>
<p>Americans for Prosperity has signed a<a href="https://www.ntu.org/library/doclib/RTPA-Coalition-Letter.pdf"> coalition letter</a> opposing a proposed online sales tax, describing it as &#8220;bad politics, bad policy, and bad precedent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creating an online sales tax defies longstanding practice. Doing so undermines the Supreme Court&#8217;s current standard that a seller must have a physical presence in a state before they can be required to collect and remit sales taxes to that state.</p>
<p>It also grossly expands state tax collection authority and subjects Americans to the whims of thousands of out-of-state tax collectors.</p>
<p>An online sales tax also flies in the face of Supreme Court precedent. In 1992, the Court ruled that companies lacking physical presence within a state would not have to collect state sales tax on purchases.</p>
<p><strong>What Congress should do instead:</strong> The Supreme Court has already agreed to hear a case on this very issue later this year. If the Court rules in favor of broadening states&#8217; taxing power, Congress can and should act to preserve due process constraints that limit the power of states to tax and regulate beyond their borders.</p>
<p>It makes little sense to stuff an online sales tax into this trillion-dollar spending bill on the heels of tax reform that&#8217;s doing so much to benefit American businesses and workers. Why undermine that progress with another burdensome tax, especially when the Supreme Court won&#8217;t hear the issue until later this year?</p>
<h4>Oppose Corporate Welfare Tax Extenders</h4>
<p>Speaking of undermining tax reform, some members of Congress want to use the omnibus to insert billions of dollars in expired corporate welfare provisions back into the tax code.</p>
<p>The recent tax reform bill intentionally eliminated the number of carve-outs for favored industries such as horse racing, motor sports, green energy and rum distilling.</p>
<p>By reviving these tax extenders, lawmakers would be forcing taxpayers to foot the bill, just months after taking this money and putting it back where it belongs: in the pockets of hardworking Americans.</p>
<p><strong>What Congress should do instead:</strong> Protect tax reform by opposing special handouts for favored industries and rejecting the revival of these egregious corporate welfare carve-outs</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Congress is debating right-to-try legislation that would give terminally ill patients and their families hope. Right-to-try gives patients access to potentially life-saving treatments and medications that haven’t received final government approval. Thirty-eight states have right-to-try laws, but a solution is still needed for doctors and patients at the federal level. While the House of Representatives recently failed to pass a version of right-to-try under a procedure that required two-thirds votes for passage, there will be another chance for this crucially important policy to become law with a majority vote when it is considered again this week. Below is the list of lawmakers who voted yes on the House right-to-try bill. Click here to tell them we’re still counting on them to keep up the fight for right-to-try and urge them to support this bill again and keep fighting to see it pass the Senate. Rep.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s move to bypass an outdated and illogical Senate “blue slip” tradition was a good move. Doing so will help ensure fair and qualified judicial nominees get the confirmation hearings they deserve. The blue slip tradition has been abused by some in the Senate to prevent qualified nominees from getting hearings. This trick harms the American people by leaving courts vacant and preventing principled nominees from moving forward in their confirmation proceedings. Ensuring judges who will uphold the Constitution and rule of law get nominated, and eventually confirmed, to courts all over this country is vital! Senators should not bog down this process. More than 170 vacancies currently exist on lower courts in this country, making it ever-so crucial that judges who will protect the rule of law are confirmed quickly. Bypassing the blue slip helped this happen. Thank Sen. Grassley today for his bold steps to bypass the antiquated blue slip policy, and advancing fair and qualified judicial nominees.    </p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last year was a great year for America’s judicial system. Thanks to the hard work and leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 2017 saw a record number of fair and qualified judges confirmed by the Senate. Ensuring that quality judges who will uphold the Constitution and rule of law get nominated is incredibly important to protecting the freedom and liberty of the American people. More than 170 vacancies currently exist on lower courts in this country, making it ever-so-crucial that judges who will protect the rule of law are confirmed quickly. Sen. McConnell’s continued leadership will help get principled judges confirmed to fill the vacancies on the lower courts of this country. Thank Sen.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Since tax reform’s enactment, millions of Americans have seen more money in their wallets and experienced benefits including lower utility rates, pay bonuses, wage increases and other savings. Businesses are investing in their communities and in their employees, and the American economy has seen new economic growth. That was the point of tax reform – to eliminate barriers to economic growth and enable every day Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. Yet, some lawmakers in Washington are now warming to the idea of imposing a new internet sales tax on hard-working Americans. AFP Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner discusses the dangers of an internet sales tax and how it threatens to erase the benefits we’ve seen from tax reform in his recent op-ed in The Hill: A national online sales-tax system would place a burden on online retailers far beyond any with which brick-and-mortar businesses have to contend. A downtown store has to compute and pay a mere handful of state and local sales taxes. Online retailers would have to calculate and apply sales taxes nationwide — for every state, county and city that assesses one. Thousands of such jurisdictions impose varying retail sales taxes.

<p>Yet, some lawmakers in Washington are now warming to the idea of imposing a new internet sales tax on hard-working Americans.</p>
<p>AFP Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner discusses the dangers of an internet sales tax and how it threatens to erase the benefits we’ve seen from tax reform in his recent <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/finance/378345-online-sales-taxes-would-be-a-dangerous-expansion-of-state-taxing-power">op-ed</a> in The Hill:</p>
<blockquote><p>A national online sales-tax system would place a burden on online retailers far beyond any with which brick-and-mortar businesses have to contend. A downtown store has to compute and pay a mere handful of state and local sales taxes. Online retailers would have to calculate and apply sales taxes nationwide — for every state, county and city that assesses one. Thousands of such jurisdictions impose varying retail sales taxes. Any business with an online presence, no matter how small, would have to find their way through this morass.</p>
<p>And getting rid of the requirement that a business maintain a physical presence in a jurisdiction before it is subject to taxation would open the door for states to expand their tax collections in other ways beyond state lines.</p>
<p>In the wake of a successful effort at tax reform that is growing the economy and benefiting tens of millions of Americans, we urge Congress and the Trump administration to keep their eye on the ball — cut taxes, control spending and eliminate regulatory barriers that get in the way of a growing economy. Don’t devise new ways to burden ordinary Americans and stifle the very economic turnaround you’ve help create.</p></blockquote>
<p>A national online sales tax would impose new barriers to growth and opportunity and ultimately make it harder for ordinary Americans to get ahead.</p>
<p>Congress and the administration should reject the idea of an internet sales tax, and instead, recommit to protecting taxpayers and implementing reforms that will cut wasteful federal spending and eliminate burdensome regulations.</p>

Now, lawmakers must defend tax reform by rejecting the renewal of these corporate handouts known as tax extenders. Tax extenders were a part of the disastrous tax code that existed prior to the passage of tax reform &#8211; a tax code that allowed the government to pick winners and losers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the amount of special tax carve outs for favored industries like horse racing, motor sports, green energy, and rum distilling, rightfully returning that money to hard-working Americans.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Representatives is considering a federal right-to-try bill to give terminally ill patients access to potentially life-saving experimental treatments. Thirty-eight states currently have right-to-try laws on the books, but there is no federal right-to-try law that extends that access to patients in all states. In previous weeks, Americans for Prosperity’s grassroots activists have kept pressure on lawmakers in Congress, urging them to act on federal right-to-try legislation. Now, with right-to-try out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and onto the floor for a vote, the momentum is clear and there is a real opportunity to pass legislation that will give terminally ill Americans access to potentially-life saving treatments. Passing right-to-try is essential to giving families and patients in dire circumstances the chance to pursue treatments that they otherwise would not be able to access. There is no time to waste.  Show your support for federal right-to-try: Tell Congress to pass right-to-try today!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last night on CBS’s 60 Minutes, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was asked about the impact of school choice policies on public schools. Citing Florida’s positive track record on education—a state with an abundance of public and private school choice options—DeVos rightly stated that when more educational options are available to families, the academic outcome of students in traditional public schools improve.   60 Minutes host Lesley Stahl challenged DeVos’s argument, however, pointing out that in DeVos’ home state of Michigan, traditional public schools don’t appear to be making progress. DeVos’ inarticulate response has opened her up to attacks, but the Secretary’s conclusion was correct, and the line of questioning itself misses the point.   As it turns out, poor outcomes in Michigan cannot be blamed on increased educational options, as the state still lags when it comes to educational freedom. In fact, Michigan currently does not have any private school choice programs. And as noted by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, “not only is educational choice limited to public schools, but the Michigan Constitution actually prohibits any public benefit from being used to help students attend a private school (other than transportation). No other state constitution is more restrictive.”  Moreover, DeVos is right to point out that educational freedom affects public schools in a positive way, and there’s evidence that Michigan’s public schools would benefit from expanding choice beyond just public schools, especially since sound research has demonstrated that the availability of educational options improves public school performance. According to EdChoice:  &#8220;Thirty-three empirical studies have been conducted [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Stahl’s inferences that education freedom hurts public school students and that more funding is the answer for better educational outcomes simply don’t pass muster.

AFP’s 36 state chapters held over 75 grassroots events throughout 2017 and worked with community leaders, elected officials and policy experts to draw attention to tax reform’s benefits. On the federal level, AFP’s government affairs team held over 1,000 meetings with congressional leaders and advanced a positive vision for principled tax reform. Now, with the historic passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, American families are experiencing a surge of wage increases, pay bonuses, increased retirement savings and utility rate cuts. But the benefits of tax reform are far from over. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has lowered rates across the board and has spurred more than 300 companies nationwide to reinvest in their employees and in the American economy. Some of the latest companies responding to tax reform in include: CarMax – Announced one-time bonuses to most hourly and commissioned full-time and part-time employees ranging from $200 to $1,500. TJ Maxx – Paid an estimated $100 million in bonuses, increased retirement fund contributions and donations to its charitable foundations. Mastercard – Announced an increase in employer retirement matching to 10 percent of an employee’s salary. Kraft [&#8230;]</p>

<p>These principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smarter Infrastructure Spending:</strong> Federal spending should be reserved for projects that are truly national priorities, where the federal government has an obvious role. Projects inherently state or local in nature should be considered by state and local governments. Federal gas tax dollars should be reserved for improving mobility, congestion or safety on the nation’s interstate highways, not building “bridges to nowhere.”</li>
<li><strong>No New Burdens: </strong>Gas tax dollars should be used only for their core purpose – the construction and maintenance of road and bridge infrastructure. Lawmakers should stop diverting gas tax dollars to non-essential and wasteful projects and instead use them to pay for the road and bridge infrastructure for which they were originally intended.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking Through Regulatory Gridlock: </strong>Free up states by providing additional flexibility for use of federal highway funds, and devolving responsibility for some or even all highway infrastructure.<strong> </strong></li>
