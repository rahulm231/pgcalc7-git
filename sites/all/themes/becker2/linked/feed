				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becker College has established a fifth school: the School of Graduate and Professional Studies. The new school replaces the current Division of Accelerated and Professional Studies effective immediately, and centralizes the administration of the College’s graduate programs.</p>
<p>The School of Graduate and Professional Studies offers degrees and professional certificate programs in many disciplines designed to meet the needs of the adult-learner. With online and evening courses, students will be able to customize their academic experience to develop specialized skills required in today’s workplace. Additionally, the school will consolidate resources currently supporting Becker’s Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling and Master of Fine Arts in Interactive Media, which will maintain close ties with the departments where they are currently based.</p>
<p>“The addition of this fifth school allows us to keep pace with the rapidly changing professional marketplace and helps us respond to the demands of our ever-growing student body,” said Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., president of Becker College. “It also ensures that we maintain a climate of data-informed decision-making regarding graduate and professional academic programs and offerings.”</p>
<p>The new school will be headed, on an interim basis, by Ursula Furi-Perry, J.D., dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. A national search is currently underway for a new dean.</p>
<p>“Today’s global economy and ever-evolving workplace require continuous learning and development,” said Furi-Perry. “We have expanded our course offerings to better serve those individuals who see the world around them changing quickly and want to stay relevant or advance in their careers.”</p>
<p>New programs being offered at the School of Graduate and Professional Studies include: an associate’s degree in human services, bachelor’s degrees in criminal justice and homeland security, and certificate in Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Counseling.</p>
<p>The School of Graduate and Professional Studies is the latest academic unit added at the College. On July 1, the <a href="https://www.becker.edu/academic/academic-programs/humanities-social-sciences/">School of Humanities and Social Sciences</a> was formally launched and earlier this Spring, the Colleen C. Barrett Center for Global Innovation and Entrepreneurship opened, providing students access to cutting-edge technologies, including an Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality Lab, Game and Live Studios, and an Esports Lab.</p>
<p>Becker’s other schools – the School of Design and Technology, the School of Animal Studies and Natural Sciences, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences – are renowned for their programs, including nursing, animal studies and game design. The Princeton Review recently ranked Becker the #4 best school in world to study Game Design.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becker College’s School of Nursing and Health Sciences has been recognized by Colleges of Distinction for its strong record of preparing graduates for real world success. This new special field of study distinction comes on the heels of another college-wide honor by Colleges of Distinction, a national guidebook honoring schools throughout the U.S. for excellence in undergraduate-focused higher education. In March, Becker was named a national College of Distinction for creating a truly unique learning environment where students not only earn college credit and valuable life experience, but also participate in character-building programs.</p>
<p>“To have our nursing program singled out for its academic excellence is not only a great honor but also confirms that our experiential learning-approach to education is having an impact and yielding job-ready graduates,” said Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., president of Becker College. “We are pleased to receive this prestigious national designation for one of our top academic programs.”</p>
<p>The School of Nursing &amp; Health Sciences offers accredited undergraduate programs in nursing and exercise science that emphasize hands-on training and mirror the demands of the dynamic healthcare industry. Nursing graduates have consistently maintained one of the highest pass-rates on the licensing board examination.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Becker College Police Department recently participated in active shooter training. The training was facilitated by the Worcester Police Department, and took place on two days in June.</p>
<p>On the first day, the training exercises were held in Colton Hall. The unoccupied residence hall allowed police to apply techniques, both learned and new, in a typical Becker College building. On the second day, training was held at the vacant Worcester County Jail in West Boylston. This space allowed officers to apply techniques involving a long hallway and a more open building, the type of building often seen on the news. Because Becker College has both types of buildings, it was beneficial to train in both.</p>
<p>As more active shooter incidents occur, Becker’s police officers are working to improve tactics and response to not only end an event quickly, but also minimize the impact on the college.</p>
<p>The Becker College Police Department holds active shooter training multiple times a year in multiple formats. Those formats include dynamic scenarios, like those held recently, as well as classroom and electronic based training.</p>
<p>Members of the Becker Police Department want to be aware and trained on current tactics, as well as train with the surrounding agencies ― including the Leicester Police Department, Worcester Police Department and other college police departments ― in order to provide the best possible service to the community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becker College is hosting a video game summer camp for seventh&nbsp;and eighth&nbsp;grade girls from inner city and rural parts of New England. The goal of the ForEach Academy (For Each Girl to Reach) is to inspire a love of science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) and to help turn that passion into a career path.</p>
<div id="attachment_11622" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11622" src="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SteamCamp062518-300x177-300x177.jpg" alt="2018 STEAM camp participants" width="300" height="177"><p class="wp-caption-text">Participants in the girls STEAM summer camp pose for a group photo with Becker College President Nancy Crimmin, center, and some of Becker’s female faculty and graduates who are leading the program.</p></div>
<p>Participants learn to design, create and build games. They also learn the fundamentals of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Design, Modeling, and electronics. Each girl receives a free Android tablet to take home, which they use during the program to produce and operate their games.</p>
<p>ForEach Academy is primarily led by Becker’s female faculty and recent graduates. Current students serve as mentors.</p>
<p>This year, girls from Worcester, Pawtucket, Providence, Leominster, Fitchburg, Dudley, Webster and other New England towns are participating in the program. ForEach Academy is made possible through grants from leading industry organizations like the Entertainment Software Association Foundation, which seeks to use video game technology to spark STEAM-interest in under-served populations.</p>
<p>“By working alongside positive role models and teaching them new skills, we hope to inspire, lead, encourage, and spark an interest in game programming and STEAM subjects for girls,” said Alan Ritacco, dean of the School of Design and Technology, which hosts the camp. “Exposing girls to these careers at a young age helps ensure we have a diverse and talented pipeline of future game makers and tech industry leaders.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recognizing the economic and professional opportunities generated by the burgeoning esports, or competitive gaming, industry, Becker College announced a new Bachelor of Science in Esports Management. The four-year degree is the latest academic offering launched by Becker’s School of Design and Technology, joining the Masters in Fine Arts in Interactive Media, which also debuts this fall.</p>
<p>First of its kind in the country, Becker’s Esports Management major — offered through the College’s business department — will equip students with the knowledge and experience needed to excel in one of the fastest-growing sectors in the sports and entertainment industries. Focused on providing students with practical, hands-on learning and an entrepreneurial outlook, the degree will prepare students for the future of work in the&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/28/as-pro-gaming-takes-off-so-do-esports-careers/">booming esports industry</a>. Careers in esports encompass content creators, streamers, influencers, community managers, game developers, producers, and commentators, in addition to marketers, accountants, lawyers, a host of other experts who work for esports and game companies, and, of course, professional gamers.</p>
<p>“The rapid growth of esports brings with it new jobs and demands from the industry. That translates to tremendous career opportunities for our students” said Alan Ritacco, dean of the School of Design and Technology.&nbsp; “With a spirited college community that gets video games, adding esports management is a perfect fit.”</p>
<p>Building on Becker’s reputation as a future-focused institution and a leader in game design, the Esports Management&nbsp;<a href="https://www.becker.edu/academic/academic-programs/design-technology/bachelor-of-science-in-esports-management/">curriculum</a>&nbsp;emphasizes the business side of this exciting industry. Students <img class="size-medium wp-image-12376 alignright" src="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TeamPhoto1-225x300.jpg" alt="esports team at Becker College" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TeamPhoto1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TeamPhoto1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />will be immersed in the culture and climate of esports, and will gain skills in planning and strategy, event management and promotion, business development, game technology, marketing, and finance. They will also explore the dominant game genres that make up the industry.</p>
<p>Transfer students interested in the esports management major can begin inquiring about January admission immediately. Enrollment for first-year students begins in the fall of 2019.&nbsp; Becker — ranked fourth in world for game design by The Princeton Review, and sixth for its Master in Fine Arts in Interactive Media design — is the only college in Massachusetts to offer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.becker.edu/becker-launches-varsity-esports-program/">varsity esports</a>&nbsp;scholarships.</p>
<p>Last year, there were 588 major global esports events, including League of Legends World Championship, which was the most watched program on Amazon’s Twitch, with 49.5 million hours, according to industry researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/21/newzoo-esports-could-hit-380-million-fans-and-906-million-in-revenues-in-2018/">Newzoo</a>. By 2021, the esports audience is expected to grow to 557 million. Companies like Mercedes Benz, Gillette, Red Bull and many others have already jumped on the esports bandwagon. Professional sports teams like the Boston Celtics are fielding squads in the new&nbsp;<a href="https://2kleague.nba.com/">NBA 2K League</a>, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft recently spent $20 million to buy Boston Uprising, a team in&nbsp;<a href="https://uprising.overwatchleague.com/home">Blizzard’s Overwatch League</a>. Plus, esports is being eyed as a demonstration event in the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see a school like Becker College leading the field in establishing its new Esports Management degree,” said Marco Mereu, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://estarz.com/">Estarz</a>, a pioneer in esports entertainment and an advisory board member of the School of Design and Technology. “Much as they did with their game design program, Becker will enable students to be prepared for the fast-moving and growing industry of esports.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This fall, Becker College students will be able to try out for a new varsity sport — competitive video gaming, or esports. League of Legends, one of the most popular video games of all-time, will be the college’s inaugural title in its new varsity esports program. Becker, internationally ranked for its game design major, is the first college in Massachusetts to offer scholarships to varsity esports student-athletes.<img class="size-medium wp-image-9394 alignright" src="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Esports-Team-300x225.jpg" alt="Becker College Esports Team" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Esports-Team-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Esports-Team-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Esports-Team-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Building on the success and growth of the College’s esports club, the program’s goal is to establish Becker as a championship-driven esports powerhouse. Student-athletes will have access to state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, as well as experienced staff and online training through Boston-based <a href="https://www.gamersensei.com/">Gamer Sensei</a>, the world’s top source for esports coaching. Scholarships of up to $5,000 per year will be awarded to select student-athletes based on ability, academics, communication skills and playing position.</p>
<p>“Collegiate esports is happening, and it makes all the sense in the world for Becker, already a pioneer in game design, to be leading the way in Massachusetts,” said Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., president of Becker College. “With a campus community that is passionate about games, adding esports is a natural fit for us.”</p>
<p>With more than 100 million players a month, <a href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">Riot’s League of Legends</a> (LoL) is the most popular video game in the world. In 2017, the LoL World Championship was the most watched program on Amazon’s Twitch, with 49.5 million hours.</p>
<p>“Our esports varsity program will mirror many traditional varsity sports rules and regulations, complete with tryouts, uniforms, practice schedules and academic achievement standards,” said Timothy Loew, Becker’s varsity esports general manager and executive director of the <a href="https://www.massdigi.org/">Massachusetts Digital Games Institute</a> (MassDiGI). “Given the popularity of our esports club, I fully expect to be adding more varsity teams in games like <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/">Hearthstone</a> and <a href="http://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a> over the next academic year.”</p>
<p>The esports audience is expected to grow to 557 million by 2021, according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/21/newzoo-esports-could-hit-380-million-fans-and-906-million-in-revenues-in-2018/">Newzoo</a>. Professional teams like the Boston Celtics are fielding squads in the new <a href="https://2kleague.nba.com/">NBA 2K League</a>, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft recently spent $20 million to buy Boston Uprising, a team in <a href="https://uprising.overwatchleague.com/home">Blizzard’s Overwatch League</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 80 U.S. colleges and universities have esports varsity teams and many members of athletic conferences like the PAC 12, Big Ten and Ivy League support esports on campus.</p>
<p>“Becker’s League of Legends club team just had a solid year, and proved to be fierce competitors,” said William Collis, founder of Genji Esports and <a href="https://teamgenji.com/">Team Genji</a>, currently one of the top three Hearthstone teams worldwide. “They will definitely be a force to be reckoned with at the varsity level. Who knows? Soon we may even see a Becker alum playing for us.”</p>

<p>NESGDS gave students who are studying game design at New England colleges an opportunity to compete against each other. It highlighted the talent and innovation of the region’s game design students, and it underscored the growing importance of the game industry in the northeast.</p>

<p>“This show, which had representation from more than 16 colleges and universities, was the first of its kind targeted strictly at the college population in New England,” said Paul Cotnoir, director of design programs at Becker College. “It demonstrated both the incredible talent of our local interactive media students and Becker College’s leadership role in the promotion of those students and their work.”</p>
<p>Cotnoir noted that the event gave students an opportunity to network with a variety of industry and academic experts about their games. It also gave them a chance to network with each other, learn from each other and create new peer networks among like-minded game students.</p>
<p>“New England-trained game designers, artists and developers are among the best and are having a huge impact in the gaming industry as well as the commercial sector,” said Alan Ritacco, dean of the School of Design and Technology. “We know our students are innovative and capable of producing quality games. Now, the region has had a chance to see that firsthand.”</p>
<p>Students from more than 20 New England-area schools, including Becker College, Bunker Hill Community College, Champlain College, MIT, Emerson College, UConn, Quinnipiac, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Rhode Island School of Design, submitted a total of 270 entries. Students came from as far away as Burlington, VT—200 miles—to attend.</p>
<p>Becker College alum Ryan Canuel, CEO of Petricore Inc., and Tim Loew, executive director of the Massachusetts Digital Games Institute at Becker College, were among the judges for the event, where more than $1,000 in prizes were handed out. Prizes were awarded the areas of animation, art, technical innovation and game play. Becker College’s Hamster game took second place in the game play category.</p>
<p>Both organizers and participants said the event was an unqualified success, and plans are underway for next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becker College celebrated its rich and long history on May 19 with the dedication of The Minutemen Room on the Leicester Campus.</p>
<p>Becker’s strong record of preparing entrepreneurial, innovative graduates for real-world success can be traced back to the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century with the opening of Leicester Academy in 1784. The Academy became Leicester Junior College (LJC) in 1941, and in 1977 merged with Becker Junior College of Business Administration and Secretarial Science, forming Becker Junior College—which became Becker College in 1990, with campuses in Leicester and Worcester.</p>
<div id="attachment_6321" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6321" src="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MinutemenRoomDedication_5-21-18-300x217-300x217.jpg" alt="Minutemen room dedication" width="300" height="217"><p class="wp-caption-text">Alumni and guests listen to archivist Nancy Richards and admire artifacts during the dedication of the Minutemen Room in Leicester on May 19.</p></div>
<p>Alumni from all classes of LJC were invited for a reunion that coincided with the dedication. The room—named in honor of the Leicester Minutemen, the name given to LJC’s varsity athletic teams—features a Wall of History, a visual and historical timeline displaying more than a dozen black-and-white photographs, plaques, banners and assorted college-related mementos. A full run of LJC yearbooks and sports memorabilia, including two championship letter jackets, was on temporary display during the dedication. Becker College’s Athletics Hall of Fame is filled with LJC student-athletes who distinguished themselves in soccer, baseball, and basketball. In 1964, the basketball Minutemen—led by legendary coach Paige Rowden—became “instant countrywide celebrities” when they won their first regional title and advanced to the national tournament, becoming the first team from New England to do so.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the generosity of Leicester Junior College alumnus Danny DelMastro ’70 and many other loyal donors, the Minutemen Room will preserve and help pass on the legacy of this time in our shared history to future students, faculty and staff,” said Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., president of Becker College. “From the moment guests step into the room, they’ll be immersed in the ethos of Leicester Junior College’s rich culture and traditions, and have a better understanding of our evolution into Becker College today.”</p>

<p>A new college degree brings new opportunities and benefits but also great responsibility – a responsibility to oneself and the community. That was the message Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito delivered to Becker College’s 389 graduates during the 230th Commencement ceremony on Saturday, May 5 at Worcester’s DCU Center.</p>
<p>“Now you have to think about what’s going to make you happy. What truly will provide the joy and happiness that is going to drive you out of bed every day with eagerness, energy and the adrenaline rush to push forward?” said Polito, the 2018 Commencement Speaker and one of four Honorary Degree recipients. “Be mindful of what makes you happy and make that the center of your compass.”</p>
<p>Polito also urged graduates to “be intentional” with their degrees, encouraging them to stay in Worcester and make an impact in the place that has “meant something very special to you over the past few years.”</p>
<p>“Think about how your degree can impact a community like this. Think about making the Commonwealth your permanent home, and if you are from here think about planting your roots even further,” she said. “We have a talent pipeline that is rich and robust.”</p>
<p>A lifelong Shrewsbury resident, Polito shared the story of her great-grandfather, Francesco Polito, a brick maker from Italy who arrived in the U.S. in 1909 determined to provide a better life for his family. She recounted how he started making concrete blocks by hand and, through hard work, saved enough money to buy his first piece of machinery. That helped propel his business into a thriving construction company, which the Polito family still operates. She reminded graduates to always strive for more and better while honoring the hard work and legacy of those who came before us.</p>
<p>Becker President Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., also reminded students of the responsibility that comes with their degrees, not just to themselves but to society.</p>
<p>“As educated citizens, you are responsible for surveying the world around you and helping those who need it the most,” said Crimmin, Becker College’s first female president. “During your time at Becker, you have learned the Core Values. Do not leave these values behind. Let them become part of all that you do. They will not only make you a successful person; they will make you a good person.”</p>
<p>She called on the graduates to lead purposeful lives, seek continuous personal and professional growth, and “be creative, innovative thinkers.”</p>
<p>In addition to Polito, Honorary Degrees were also bestowed upon Sam Vaghar, Executive Director and Co-Founder of The Millennium Campus Network; Eric Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of the College for Social Innovation; and Dr. Gregory Pogue, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer at The College of New Jersey. A 1970 Becker Junior College graduate, Dr. Pogue is the first recipient of the Distinguished Alumni Honorary Degree, a tradition started under President Crimmin.</p>
<p>Becker’s Commencement honored graduation candidates from the following undergraduate and graduate degree programs and the Accelerated Studies program:</p>
<p><strong>Master’s Degrees</strong><br />
Mental Health Counseling</p>
<p><strong>Bachelor’s Degrees</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the fourth time in as many years, a Becker College student has been selected to participate in StartUp Worcester, an entrepreneurship initiative designed to nurture startups. Racquel Knight, founder of One Chair 4 One Child (OC4OC), a social business that is working to improve education in Jamaica by providing every student in rural schools with a sturdy, adequate chair, was recently chosen for this program, sponsored by the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>“I am very grateful to have gotten this opportunity from StartUp Worcester. This definitely puts OC4OC in the right direction,” said Knight, a fourth-year Global Citizenship major who began developing her idea at Becker’s Yunus Social Business Centre and executed her business plan under the mentorship of the College’s professors. “We are finally getting situated, and I know I’ll be able to grow from here.”</p>
<div id="attachment_4480" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-4480 size-medium" src="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_2768-300x225.jpg" alt="Racquel Knight, Founder of OC4OC" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_2768-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.becker.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_2768.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(L-R) Karen Pelletier, WRCC’s VP of operations and director of education and workforce development; and Racquel Knight, Founder of OC4OC</p></div>
<p>Social businesses work to identify problems and create self-sustaining business solutions that have social impact, while generating jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities that drive economic development regionally and around the world.</p>
<p>Knight joins 11 other small Worcester businesses. StartUp Worcester participants are chosen from a pool of 26 applicants whose business proposals are ranked based on the companies’ potential for viability and growth, readiness and business model strength. Finalists then go on to pitch their business ideas to a panel of judges that selects the winners.</p>
<p>“We are so proud to support our region’s young entrepreneurs and help them grow their business here,” said Karen Pelletier, vice president of operations and director of education and workforce development at the chamber. “These bright and very talented graduates, like Racquel, are instrumental to maintaining a vibrant local economy and community,”</p>
<p>Program participants – many of whom are graduates of the area’s colleges and universities – have access to work space, publicity, business resources and a network of professionals. Additionally, they receive a one-year membership in the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Past Becker College participants of StartUp Worcester are: Ryan Canuel ’15, Petricore Games; Breeze Grigas ’13, Zephyr Workshop; Rejon Taylor-Foster ’17, Maximum Crash; and Tyler Haddad ’18, Psychoactive Entertainment. Petricore Games, whose staff of six consists entirely of Becker College graduates, operates out of the Massachusetts Digital Games Institute (MassDiGI) New Ventures Center in the Colleen C. Barrett Center on the College’s Worcester campus.</p>
<p>“Racquel, just like the Becker students before her who also earned a spot in this coveted program, perfectly embodies the entrepreneurial spirit and agility we instill in each of our students,” said Nancy P. Crimmin, Ed.D., president of Becker College. “We congratulate Racquel on this well-deserved win, which puts her another step closer to fulfilling her business goals. What a great way to culminate her studies at Becker.”</p>
<p>This year’s winners will be formally announced during a press conference and reception on Thursday, May 10, 4 to 6 pm at the Worcester Clean Tech Incubator, 44 Portland St., 4th fl., Worcester, MA.</p>
