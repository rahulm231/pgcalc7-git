<p>CHICAGO — Kids from Garfield Park helped put up an inspirational mural on a violence-plagued block in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>The mural, which says “You are beautiful,” was painted on the side of a convenience store near Homan Avenue and Walnut Street. The project was done this month, and the mural runs the length of the half-block-long convenience store.</p>
<p>Artist Matthew Hoffman led the project, but his group teamed up with <a href="http://www.breakthrough.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakthrough, an East Garfield organization that provides opportunities for kids</a>, so children from the neighborhood could help paint the message.</p>
<p>The mural “was acting as a reclaiming of this block by the children in our youth network at Breakthrough Urban Ministries,” a spokeswoman for the group said.</p>
<p>The group said the corner of Walnut and Homan has been a particularly violent intersection on the West Side.</p>
<p>Hoffman is a Chicago-based artist known for public artwork that focuses on inspirational words and messages.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up, Ciera didn’t have much, but her parents strived to ensure she was exposed to as much as possible. She was a star lacrosse player, played musical instruments, joined numerous student leadership clubs like Future Business Leaders of America, and went to church each Sunday.</p>
<p>Her parents were the biggest drivers of her success, supporting Ciera’s development in anyway they could and also challenging her to be excellent in all she did. Ciera’s family values placed an emphasis on education, and her parents did their best to model and exemplify their expectations for her.</p>
<p>Ciera’s mother demonstrated a commitment to education by finishing her undergraduate degree with Ciera in high school and her brother finishing up elementary school. Their mother graduated with her master’s degree in 2012 while Ciera finished undergrad, which she completed in 2014.</p>
<p>“I think my mom has set one of the best examples of being a black woman in a predominately white setting,” she said. “My mom is a perfectionist, and one of the most awesome people I know. She’s the person I try to model myself after most.”</p>
<p>Ciera’s father was a Philadelphia fireman who died in the line of duty. His vision for Ciera was for her to thrive academically because of the climate of competition in America’s workforce. He preached to her the importance of “doing the best you can, at all times,” because of the challenges he feared she would face as a black woman.</p>
<p>Often times, Ciera was the only black girl in social settings and at school growing up in the suburbs. She said it was difficult to find support groups and mentors because of a lack of diversity in some of the communities she’s lived in, and it motivates the work she does.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from the University of Maryland as an English major, Ciera came to Chicago to serve in the Mission Year program. It was as an assistant teacher in the Breakthrough Youth Network where she discovered her love for educating youth.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75738" src="http://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ciera-justice.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="413" /></p>
<p>“Being able to walk alongside the youth and encourage them in ways that they don’t get in their schools was so fun to me,” Ciera said. “Getting to know their families, getting to be a part of their lives outside of the classroom, felt very natural.”</p>
<p>In her work at Breakthrough, Ciera has been a fervent advocate for children in Chicago to have the same opportunities to excel socially and academically as she did. “I believe youth development and education should go hand-in-hand. I’m passionate about that, and I’m passionate about seeing kids holistically developed in school settings because they are there for a majority of the day…Not being developed [holistically] in the place they spend most of their time, is detrimental to them.”</p>
<p>Ciera has worked as an assistant, an arts and science teacher, and as a lead teacher within the Nettie Bailey Student Achievement Program while at Breakthrough. She said her next endeavor will likely include working more with parents to create more dynamic partnerships to support children’s holistic development.</p>
<p>“One of my lead duties was working alongside middle school kids who were applying to high schools in CPS, which can be a complicated process,” Ciera said. “To be able to walk alongside them and the parents to advocate for them into the schools they wanted or schools that would be the right fit was really enjoyable to me.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ciera wants to open an educational center for children in underserved communities to support their needs with resources they may not have available in their schools.</p>
<p>“When I read my old college journals, I wrote down the dreams I had about opening my own school. It really began with wanting to create safe spaces for kids. And when I think about my passion for education, it goes back to my brother. We are 10 years apart, but we are like best friends. He had experiences similar to mine, being one of the only black boys in his schools.”</p>
<p>“I just want better spaces for our black kids; they deserve that,” she said.</p>
<p>This fall, Ciera took a break from her teaching duties to return to school to get an advanced degree from DePaul University in school counseling. Ideally, she’d like to stand on the frontline of fighting for equity in the education of minority children.</p>
<p>“Going back to school at DePaul is kind of that first step for me in opening my own school,” she said. “I’ve been in teaching for some time now, but I want to get into administration. My hope is that I can get into education policy and advocacy.”</p>
<p>She’s also a member of the latest cohort of the Obama Foundation Community Leadership Corps, which focuses on developing civil innovators working on transformative change in our communities. Her project, titled Lift Every Voice, centers on the arts with a focus on creative writing enrichment.</p>
<p>“I want kids to be able to tell their own stories without needing them to be told by the media,” she said. “There’s so much emphasis on STEM, that the arts are being lost &#8212; and as an English major, that’s important to me.”</p>

Scores from the ACT show that just 9 percent of students in the class of 2017 who came from low-income families, whose parents did not go to college, and who identify as black, Hispanic, American Indian, or Pacific Islander are ready for college. The readiness rate for other students was six times as high at 54%.</p>
<p>The causes of the achievement gap are often debated. Some believe that the gap is purely related to socioeconomic factors, while others argue that the lack of opportunity has been the biggest contributor. Others reference systemic racist policies that have disadvantaged some groups while advantaging others. We also must consider the cultural mismatch between the predominantly white, mono-lingual, female teaching force (81.9%)  with the ever growing ethnically diverse student population (49%). There is merit to all these arguments; however, regardless of the cause or causes of the achievement gap, the fact that we live in a country where this is an expected and on-going phenomenon is troubling.</p>
<p>The responsibility to close the achievement gap rests on many levels. From national, state, and local governmental entities, to corporations, individual citizens and concerned parents, we all have a responsibility to work to ensure children have the opportunity to succeed. Through my work at Breakthrough, I have made it my life’s mission to strive toward closing the achievement gap in East Garfield Park.</p>

<hr /><p><em>To truly address the achievement gap, we need to address its root causes.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.breakthrough.org/innovative-strategy-closes-the-achievement-gap-on-chicagos-west-side/&#038;text=To%20truly%20address%20the%20achievement%20gap%2C%20we%20need%20to%20address%20its%20root%20causes.&#038;via=brkthru&#038;related=brkthru' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" >Click To Tweet</a><br /><hr />
<p>There are 6,140 individuals under the age of 18 in East Garfield Park; this makes up 30% of the community. Along with committed parents, resilient students, dedicated school personnel, partner universities, and other non-profits, Breakthrough is working to bring additional resources and relationships to attack the achievement gap. In spaces once considered devoid of opportunity, we plan to create more. We have a two-pronged approach to closing the achievement gap and reducing the opportunity gaps that exists for children in East Garfield Park. This includes providing high quality direct education services and a youth development strategy that we call the Network Model.</p>
<p>We first provide direct education opportunities for students ages 2-18, which includes year-round preschool and afterschool education.  We also provide a robust menu of extracurricular opportunities. Extracurricular activities have been linked with increasing academic achievement and lowering participation in risky behaviors, but many are cost prohibitive. Greg Duncan, an economist at the University of California Irvine, estimates that families earning $25,000 a year spend roughly $1,300 per child per year on summer camp, vacations, outings, and educational programming; whereas families earning $135,000 year spend almost 10 times that amount.</p>
<p>To address the achievement gap long term, Breakthrough is working to counter generational poverty that exists in the community. Studies have shown that the more education one earns, the higher his or her earning power will be. In fact, a person with a Bachelor’s degree will earn approximately 60% more than someone with only a high school diploma. Breakthrough’s generational approach begins in our early childhood education program, the Breakthrough Beginners, because the achievement gap is already well established by time a student enters kindergarten. We partner with families early on to meet the cognitive, social, and physical milestones that their children will need to achieve at high levels throughout their lives. As students move through our programs and onto college, we expect that they will be better prepared and resourced because of their time spent at Breakthrough.</p>
<p>Last year alone, we served just over 1,200 youth participants through our programs. 76% of students either maintained or improved to above average scores in reading, 85% reported supportive relationships with adult staff and volunteers they met at Breakthrough, 100% of students reported an increase in knowledge of STEAM careers, and 94% of preschoolers are prepared for kindergarten. These successes are chipping away at the achievement gap in the community.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75734 size-full" src="http://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-3.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-3.png 600w, https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Most recently, we have begun to support our students as they transition to college. This year, in partnership with two foundations, we were able to award $30,000 in college scholarships and host a community trunk party for 54 local rising college freshmen. By the year 2020, we anticipate our high school and college programming will be more robust to meet the growing need.</p>
<p>Breakthrough’s direct programs would not be effective without a thoughtful and relevant strategy behind them. Therefore, Breakthrough has developed and implemented an innovative approach to build social capital for students in East Garfield Park. We do this through what we call the Network Model and is the second method we use to close the achievement gap.</p>
<p>The Network Model connects youth with caring adults to provide mentorship, access, exposure and accountability as they navigate life. This model not only surrounds students with support and care, but also opens doors of opportunity and provides access to resources that students might not have had otherwise. These caring adults impact students in a variety of ways &#8211; as an industry professional who is exposing students to new career fields, such as robotics; as a mentor who encourages a student through trauma; as a running partner who challenges a student to accomplish a personal fitness goal; as a homework helper who provides reading interventions; or as an artist who helps a student express ideas creatively. Through the Network Model, students have more access and opportunity than ever before.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-75732" src="http://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-1.png 600w, https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcie-Curry-Quote-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>To truly address the achievement gap, we need to address its root causes &#8211; discriminatory policies, poverty, insufficient opportunities, and cultural mismatches between kids and their teachers/mentors. The work will not be accomplished in my lifetime, but we all must do our part. We never want a student in East Garfield Park to be limited in life because of a lack of opportunity and access. We never want a student in East Garfield Park to weather the storms of life without supportive relationships. In this community, we reject the continuation of generational poverty and in its place, strive for prosperity for all who call this neighborhood home.</p>

<p>The Educator’s Appreciation Luncheon, organized by the Garfield Park Youth Collaborative, brought together staff from West Side schools to create new relationships and partnerships, celebrate each other’s accomplishments, and share a meal with kindred spirits before grading homework becomes the norm.</p>
<p>CPS CEO Dr. Janice Jackson delivered the keynote address, in which she spoke on the need and value of successful students in communities of color. She asked the educators to keep pushing forward in their work to develop young minds, while assuring them that they are supported.</p>
<p>“We have extraordinary work to do,” Dr. Jackson said. “We have to make exponential gains, in particular in our communities of color, if we are really serious about making sure every, single student in this city has a shot at the American dream; has a shot sitting at tables like you are today; has the same shot as a little girl from 79th and Racine has to lead the third largest school district in the country.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75082" src="http://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Janice-Jackson.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="227" srcset="https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Janice-Jackson.jpg 512w, https://www.breakthrough.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Janice-Jackson-300x133.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>Dedicated teachers were honored for their service and grants were awarded to passionate teachers with innovative approaches to improving their classrooms. Examples of the awarded proposals included an art project display gallery for middle schoolers and “chair pockets” to help younger children keep up with their belongings.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Community Education Liaison Gynger Garcia said it is an honor to throw the event to celebrate important people and vital institutions in the community.</p>
<p>“This luncheon is an annual celebration geared toward commending local teachers as they kick off the new school year,” Garcia said. “Community organizations join forces and network so all are aware of available neighboring resources. It&#8217;s truly a time to gather and celebrate all the hard and dedicated work happening for the good of children in East Garfield Park.”</p>
<p>The luncheon was catered by <a href="http://www.breakthrough.org/familyplex/bridge-cafe/">Breakthrough&#8217;s Bridge Cafe</a>, a favorite cafe spot for local educators, and teachers left with school supplies for their classrooms. The delicious spread and free resources will help these CPS leaders kick off an exciting new school year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going off to college is as exciting as it is daunting for some students. While students across the country dread imminent math and science coursework, some are also worried if they’ll have enough printer paper, toilet tissue, and instant ramen to make it through the semester.</p>
<p>For 52 graduating seniors in East Garfield Park, the strain of college life was made lighter at the Breakthrough Trunk Party August 4.</p>
<p>A trunk party is a celebratory event where the network of a graduating student showers the student with gifts, donations, words of affirmation, and sound advice before they head off to college. It is a rite of passage for families that lack the resources to fully fund their child’s college experience. Breakthrough student Bre&#8217;jona Hutchinson dreamed up the concept of a community-wide trunk party and Breakthrough staff put her dream into motion.</p>
<p>At the trunk party, students and their families packed the FamilyPlex for a day centered on providing resources that will help power students’ academic success. A panel of college students and recent grads opened the event with advice on how to navigate the collegiate environment. The keynote speaker, Breakthrough Communications Coordinator DeMario Phipps-Smith, spoke about focusing on your journey and the impact of marrying one’s passion and talent.</p>
<p>Then, local students were ushered to the back of the gymnasium, where they were able to select items for their “trunk,” via a completely free shopping-style experience. Hundreds of various college necessities like trash cans, carpets, and shower caddies were donated to Breakthrough totaling $15,000 in donations. Many students said they saw the Trunk Party as a source of inspiration and proof that their community was invested in their academic success.</p>
<p>The location space was set up to mimic the design of a networking event so that the young students would be encouraged to mingle with guests and get some experience connecting with those outside of their support network. The catering for the Trunk Party was provided by Little Goat Diner in the West Loop, which included o&#8217;devours, lunch and cupcakes for the attendees.</p>
<p>“The gifts and support that I receive at Breakthrough Trunk Party will not only provide me with the necessities to begin college,” Crystal Montgomery, 19, said. “But these gifts will be a constant reminder of the community of people that are behind me while I continue on this next chapter of my life.”</p>
<p>Breakthrough Senior Director Marcie Curry said the students will face many challenges during their college careers but hopes that they feel supported and inspired by the community to push through the difficult times.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“To be able to provide our future leaders with not only the physical items to transition to college dorm life but also the emotional support to know that their community believes in them was a highlight for me. Leaving East Garfield Park for college is both a blessing and a great challenge. We pray that these college students will always know they have the love and support of their Breakthrough community. The Trunk Party was a tangible way to express that love to them.”</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Breakthrough Young Professionals Board welcomed scores of emerging leaders to the “Aspire: Finding Meaning In Work” panel discussion and networking reception at Jenner &amp; Block in downtown Chicago last week. The largest Aspire crowd to date was guided through a conversation of how to balance a busy work-life schedule with the value of staying involved in our communities through advocacy and volunteering.</p>
<p>The panel discussion featured CEOs and executive leaders from industries in tech, advocacy, marketing, and education. The speakers delved into conversations that ranged from recruitment and talent development strategies to exploring why nonprofits can provide viable career opportunities.</p>
<p>Illinois Action for Children Vice President of Organizational Advancement Sandy Matthews stressed the importance of living in one’s purpose. “Every day for the past 12 years I&#8217;ve woken up and lived my mission. And I encourage all of you to think about mission-driven organizations as a career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank M. Clark, president of the Chicago Board of Education, echoed her sentiments about using your passion to fuel the success of your career. “I guarantee you that if you&#8217;re actively involved in non-profits on your resume, it will set you apart from others.”</p>
<p>The candor and honesty of the speakers portrayed in the discussion helped drive its conversational tone. Members of the audience were even asked to participate in the discussion by announcing their social concerns when the mic was turned to them. Some of the responses included youth development, refugee rights and equal pay for minorities in the workplace.</p>
<p>Young Professionals Board President Jamie Lavigueur said she was pleased to see the progression of the Aspire event thanks to the help of great panelists and attendees.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Aspire is really what the YP Board is all about. It’s a time when we can come together as young professionals, support Breakthrough, and learn how to grow in our careers with the help of those who paved the way before us,” she said. “I am so grateful for the authenticity of our panelists and their willingness to share, and all the people who help make this one of the best nights of the year for us.”</em></p></blockquote>

There are dozens of neighborhoods in this city being transformed, but there is still work to be done to ensure all neighborhoods and their residents are able to thrive in safe communities. When it comes to addressing the history and frequency of violence, it is important to consider the trauma people are experiencing and how that impacts neighborhood safety.</p>
<h3>TRAUMA</h3>
<p>Trauma is an event or series of physically or emotionally harmful events that have lasting adverse effects on the individual&#8217;s mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. . Childhood traumatic experiences have a tremendous impact on future violence victimization and perpetration, as well as lifelong health and opportunity. Per the Center for Disease Control, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been linked to chronic health conditions, low life potential,and early death. The more a child is exposed to trauma, the higher risk they are for these negative health outcomes. In addition to trauma, Breakthrough has found that many individuals experience co-occurring disorders, including substance abuse and mental illness, which makes it that much more difficult to achieve stability.</p>
<p>The effects of trauma on an individual can be devastating, but if you extrapolate those ramifications throughout an entire community, it can be catastrophic.</p>

<hr /><p><em>Supporting our neighbors starts with understanding their trauma.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.breakthrough.org/how-trauma-informed-care-is-revitalizing-community/&#038;text=Supporting%20our%20neighbors%20starts%20with%20understanding%20their%20trauma.&#038;via=brkthru&#038;related=brkthru' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" >Click To Tweet</a><br /><hr />
<h3>RESPONSE</h3>
<p>Because trauma is a prevalent factor in many of the issues challenging our community, Breakthrough implements this four-pronged approach in our interactions, facilities, and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realizing the prevalence of trauma</li>
<li>Addressing trauma through prevention and intervention methods</li>
<li>Resisting re-traumatization</li>
<li>Ensuring our staff are trained and supported to provide trauma-informed care</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Breakthrough joined the community in 2000, we have been dedicated to providing services that responded to trauma and were representative of the needs of East Garfield Park residents. With the housing market in disarray, we focused on services that would help our neighbors remain in stable homes and programs for temporary housing. As the price of healthy food grew over the years, we expanded our services to include the Fresh Market, which has distributed over 1 million pounds of fresh food since 2014.</p>
<p>Building on this model of trauma-informed care and listening to the community, Breakthrough convened with eight other community-focused outreach organizations as part of <a href="https://www.metrofamily.org/cp4p/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Communities Partnering 4 Peace</a> (CP4P)—a city-wide collaboration aimed at reducing shootings, creating safe spaces, and professionalizing the violence prevention field. It is the first time many organizations and services have joined together to reduce violence in local communities through nonviolence and trauma-informed care.</p>
<p>CP4P targets individuals at highest risk of being perpetrators and victims of violence. Our approach includes creating authentic relationships in communities facilitated by local organizations skilled in and informed by peace, trauma, and wraparound services all facilitated by capable outreach workers who live and work in the communities they serve. This work is only possible with a deep understanding of the trauma that impacts the daily lives of individuals in East Garfield Park.</p>
<h3>SEEKING WELLNESS</h3>
<p>As members of the local community, we are elated to see our friends and neighbors thrive. We celebrate with them accomplishments like sending their last of three children to college or being elected to the local school council. We also mourn with them when life is lost to gun and street violence and are committed to partnering with them to create a safe, stable, and engaged community.</p>
<p>Through addressing trauma, we are able to help individuals in our community heal, develop new problem solving skills and feel supported by developing roadmaps that engage, empower, and create supported individuals. This is key to helping people discover wellness at an individual and community level. Only through a trauma-informed lens, collaboration, and the pursuit of community wellness will we see recovery from trauma and revitalized communities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term “going back to school” takes on an entirely different meaning for many high school seniors across the country. For the first time, their lists of back-to-school needs have expanded beyond pencils and composition books to the realm of bedding, toiletries and personal grooming.</p>
<p>To support the youth of East Garfield Park as they aspire to tackle higher education, Breakthrough honored six neighborhood seniors for the inaugural Greer Scholarship program at a special banquet on Tuesday, July 17 at the FamilyPlex.</p>
<p>The scholarship, which focuses on minority and disadvantaged youth with an interest in STEM related careers, is intended to fill financial gaps after the student’s institution has declared her financial package. Once awarded, the $3,000 scholarship is renewable for up to four years of the student’s academic career. The scholars are also placed with a mentor to help guide them through the rigors of academia and an invitation to Breakthrough’s Trunk Party on August 4 to help them make “dorm life” more comfortable.</p>
<p>The level of access young people have toward improving their academic and professional trajectory is an indicator of the viability of a community. As more resources are developed for East Garfield Park, Breakthrough Senior Director Dr. Marcie Curry said there needs to be a priority on youth and education to help empower those within the community to shape it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Over the years, we have seen so many students gain acceptance to 4-year universities but be unable to attend because their financial gap is too large,” she said. “The scholarship that we have been able to award this year have helped close that gap and allow students to attend. Students in East Garfield Park need access to higher education in order to reach their potential, become contributors to their community, and inspire future generations that anything is possible!”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>At the scholarship banquet Tuesday, families of the award recipients were present to witness their scholars sign their scholarship letters. Attendees were also treated to a dinner and a meet-and-greet with the students following the meal.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you to the Greer Foundation and congratulations to these incredible seniors.</strong></p>

<p>Home Court, an annual summer block party series, was created more than a decade ago to offer a safe and engaging space for the residents of Garfield Park during its historically violent summer months. With help from the community and long-time partners, Home Court has grown from a youth basketball tournament to a summer-long, weekend block party for all ages. Thanks to collaboration with <a href="https://www.metrofamily.org/cp4p/">Communities Partnering 4 Peace</a>, each Home Court Friday features a concert or movie screening following the daytime activities.</p>
<p>As young adults get ready to transition to college life across the country, <a href="https://www.aboyandhisdream.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Boy and His Dream</a> Founder Sunny Akhigbe chose eight high school seniors from East Garfield Park to honor at the Foundation’s first scholarship award ceremony Friday. Founded in 2015, “A Boy and His Dream” was created to help support children like the four billion youth globally dealing with a lack of resources and opportunity similar to what Akhigbe experienced growing up.</p>

<p>Akhigbe said being able to support the recipients in their educational endeavors is the type of legacy he always wanted for himself and his foundation.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Just knowing that from 10 years from now, A Boy and His Dream will be part of the change we are hoping to see in this world, that is the legacy and impact we hope to leave,” he said. “It all starts with just one kid.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Home Court series is committed to serving the residents of Garfield Park, including its youth. Through fun and engaging activities, Breakthrough hopes to bring the community together to usher in a safe and stable summer for all to enjoy.</p>
