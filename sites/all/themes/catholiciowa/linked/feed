				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For Immediate Release</strong><br />
<strong>Date: </strong>June 29, 2016<br />
<strong>Contact</strong>: Jason Kurth (515) 237-5061    &#8211;      <a href="mailto:info@catholicfoundationiowa.org">info@catholicfoundationiowa.org</a></p>
<p><strong>Executive Director to Join Foundation  </strong></p>
<p>Bishop Richard Pates announced today the hiring of a new Executive Director for The Catholic Foundation of Southwest Iowa effective Aug. 15.</p>
<p>Chris McCarville will become the second director for the foundation, which was founded in 2012.  McCarville succeeds Mark Reed, who led the foundation through its early growth. Beginning with roughly $30 million in 2012, the foundation manages more than $65 million today.</p>
<p>McCarville has been serving at Holy Family Catholic Schools in the Archdiocese of Dubuque as Director of Institutional Advancement, where his leadership was critical to the success of a $17 million capital campaign to renovate Wahlert Catholic High School.  McCarville is known in the community for his effective building of relationships, his passion and energy.</p>
<p>“Chris McCarville brings exceptional talent and energy to The Catholic Foundation of Southwest Iowa at a significant moment in its development.  Moreover, he is fully committed to the Catholic vision of the Foundation.  We welcome him and his wife, Erica, to Des Moines and The Catholic Foundation’s outreach to southwest Iowa,” Bishop Pates said.</p>
<p>A search committee comprised of board members led an extensive three-month process.</p>
<p>“I am extremely grateful for the time and effort our board members offered to help us,” said Bishop Richard Pates.</p>
<p>The Catholic Foundation of Southwest Iowa is dedicated to advancing stewardship through best financial practices and Catholic values investing.  This is accomplished by collectively improving long-term financial security for our parish/organization clients, and providing comprehensive support services for faithful donors.</p>
