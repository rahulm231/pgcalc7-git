				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<input class="fooboxshare_post_id" type="hidden" value="5541"/><p><img class="alignright wp-image-5533" src="https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rick-Clark.jpg" alt="student with backpacks" width="306" height="378" srcset="https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rick-Clark.jpg 534w, https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rick-Clark-364x450.jpg 364w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" />Rick’s journey to being a transfer student at Gonzaga University is an unlikely one, but then again, much about Rick’s life has been unlikely. After growing up in poverty and occasional homelessness, surrounded by addiction and abuse, Rick dropped out of high school. He spent years working entry-level jobs, surviving paycheck to paycheck in an attempt to support his family.</p>
<p>In his forties, though, after driving past <a href="http://scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spokane Community College</a> countless times, Rick finally decided that he’d tried everything else, so he might as well try going back to school. So, in 2015, he got on a bus bound for SCC. While waiting at the bus plaza in downtown Spokane, however, Rick’s life took an unexpected turn. He met a homeless man his son’s age and discovered that the night before, all the man’s possessions, along with his backpack, had been stolen while he slept. Rick spent his last dollar buying lunch for the two of them and promised that if he came back the next day, Rick would bring him some basic supplies and food. Rick himself didn’t have much, but he knew his friends would be willing to help. Within 24 hours, after putting out a call on Facebook, Rick and his friends had gathered enough supplies to fill 25 backpacks with food, toiletries and gift cards. When he went back to the plaza the next day, the man didn’t return, but Rick knew that there were others who needed help, so he walked around downtown handing out backpacks to others in need. And thus <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Giving-Back-Packs-900350030015648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giving Back Packs</a> was formed. Since that first backpack, Rick and his growing base of social media supporters and donors have handed out more than 1,300 backpacks to homeless people in the Spokane region. Rick has also helped connect people with jobs, housing and other critical resources.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5532" src="https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rick-Clark-2.jpg" alt="student carrying backpacks" width="215" height="221" />A few days after that fateful encounter at the bus plaza, Rick did make it to <a href="http://scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spokane Community College</a>, where he enrolled as a transfer student. After a lifetime of feeling that he “wasn’t worthy of a good life,” a new world of opportunity opened up to him at SCC. He loved the personal connection he had with the faculty and the feeling that so many people cared about his success. Like many students at the Community Colleges of Spokane, Rick is a first generation, non-traditional student, and he enrolled at SCC looking for a brighter future. Rick’s experience with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Giving-Back-Packs-900350030015648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giving Back Packs</a> showed him a path forward, and he says that rather than looking for another job, he wants to lead by example to “inspire and motivate people to be part of the solution.” He says that, “If I can do it, anyone can” and that your prior life experience “doesn’t have to define you.” Rick is spreading this message to others around him, including his son, who was also inspired to enroll at SCC, and Rick and his son graduated on the very same day this spring! His daughter has also since enrolled at <a href="http://www.spokanefalls.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spokane Falls Community College</a>.</p>
<p>In looking for his next step, Rick knew he wanted to finish his education, and his son encouraged him to apply at <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonzaga University</a>. While initially hesitant, Rick looked back over his success at SCC and realized that the only thing that could limit his success was him, so he completed the application. He was shocked and amazed when he learned that not only had he been accepted at Gonzaga, but he had received a scholarship for full tuition. So, two days after completing his last class at Spokane Community College, Rick arrived at GU for new student orientation. Since then, he’s thrown himself into life as a Zag, including attending his first GU men’s basketball game!</p>
<p>He’s determined to complete the journey he started on that bus ride to SCC and is grateful to everyone who has made it possible. Rick was a recipient of the Biella Scholarship through the CCS Foundation, and he says that having so many people who believe in him is what keeps him going. He knows that “quitting isn’t an option” because he wants to prove to the scholarship donors who supported him that they made a good investment.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Rick truly believes that a brighter future is possible for himself and his family. None of this would have been possible without the generous support of Foundation donors, and Rick is inspired to continue paying forward the blessings he has received.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<input class="fooboxshare_post_id" type="hidden" value="5479"/><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5471" src="https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Brian.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="446" srcset="https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Brian.jpg 593w, https://ccsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Brian-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" />Originally from Peru, Brian came to the United States seven years ago seeking a better life. And while it’s been a struggle to get where he is now, he feels like he’s finally on track to creating a brighter future for himself and his family.</p>
<p>After spending years working low paying jobs in various restaurants, Brian knew that college was the answer to finding something better. He couldn’t afford to attend a four-year institution, so he enrolled at <a href="http://www.scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spokane Community College</a>, not knowing that it would be the decision that ultimately set him on the path towards his future. Brian says, “I felt like I belonged,” and he loved being a part of the <a href="http://www.scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCC</a> community. In fact, he was so engaged with campus life that he became active in student government and worked to improve life for his fellow students.  Along the way, he also met and fell in love with his wife, and now they have three beautiful children!</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the path has been smooth. With both Brian and his wife in school full time at <a href="http://www.scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCC</a> and working, as well as juggling raising kids, he admits that there were days “when I could barely afford the gas to get to school.” Neither he nor his wife receive any financial support from their families, so they are on their own to pay for school and daily living expenses. Textbooks were a luxury they couldn’t afford, so Brian spent his time looking for older editions that had been posted online, or checking them out from the library, if they were available. He couldn’t afford new clothes, so even during Spokane’s long winter, he had just a single pair of shorts to wear.</p>
<p>Receiving the Spokane Valley Fire Department scholarship was life changing for Brian and his wife. In addition to finally being able to buy books for his classes, Brian was even able to get a pair of long pants! But just as importantly, it showed him that someone believed in him, which “helped me believe in myself.” He was committed to proving that the scholarship was a worthwhile investment, so he worked hard and managed to graduate early, in just a year and a half, all while maintaining a 4.0 GPA!</p>
<p>After graduation, Brian transferred to Eastern Washington University and is now just a year away from graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. His wife also transferred to EWU and is graduating this quarter from the Special Education program.  Brian has maintained his high GPA and has qualified for the Dean’s List every quarter.  Thanks to his involvement in student government at SCC, he was able to get a job as a Program Coordinator with the Chicano Studies Program at EWU, and he loves being a resource and source of support for other students.</p>
<p>While Brian acknowledges that it’s still tough to make ends meet and juggle his responsibilities to school, work and family, he says that “life has already gotten better,” and he knows that he is on his way to a successful career and future. He is grateful for both the financial and emotional support the SVFD provided, because it helped him realize that “just because it’s not easy doesn’t mean it’s not possible.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, she was selected as a recipient for the Spokane Valley Fire Department employees’ scholarship, which allowed her to return for her second year.  Linda says that she “couldn’t have done it” without this financial support, and she is incredibly grateful to all the SVFD employees who are helping keep her on the path to a brighter future.  She is determined to prove that “she is worth the investment” and has been on the honor roll every quarter at SCC!  She is also active both in the Leadership Society and the Legal Advisory Board at SCC, as well as in the community, where she volunteers with Santa Express to benefit the Vanessa Behan Crisis Nursery.</p>
<p>Linda acknowledges that it has been a difficult journey battling “the depression of divorce and the emotional struggles I endured for five years,” as well as adjusting to her oldest daughter’s recent diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome.  But she is determined to succeed and knows that if she continues to work hard, she “can and will rise above the obstacles that life puts in my path.”  Part of her recovery from her abusive marriage has been realizing that her “self-worth isn’t defined by somebody else” and that she is “a strong, caring person who is raising my children to be healthy, strong, caring individuals.”  She says that “knowing other people believe in me” helps her believe in herself and stay focused on “the new life” she’s creating for herself and her children.</p>

<p>At this year’s Scholarship Social, more than 170 <a href="http://www.ccs.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCS</a> students and donors came together to celebrate the recipients of Foundation scholarships during the 2017-18 academic year.  This inspiring event gives scholarship recipients the opportunity to meet the donors who support their scholarship, and donors are given a chance to see the impact of Foundation scholarships on the lives of these students.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spokanefalls.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFCC</a> President Darren Pitcher remarked, “It was an emotional experience for all in attendance as we heard stories of personal tragedy and life situations that would stop most of us in our tracks. Yet these students persisted with just a little help from people they have never met.”  <a href="http://www.scc.spokane.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCC </a>President Kevin Brockbank added, &#8220;Words cannot describe how powerful this event was but I will go with inspiring, humbling and overwhelming.  I walked out immensely proud that I work at an institution that contributes to their success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you to each and every donor that makes this possible, and thanks to the scholarship committee members who help award each individual scholarship. We are grateful for your continued support and couldn&#8217;t do what we do without you!  And as always, thanks to <a href="http://www.mangisfotos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James &amp; Kathy Mangis Photography</a> for the beautiful photos!</p>
