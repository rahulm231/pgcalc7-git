				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Wright Academy is proud to host Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s Camp on our Tacoma campus for the fourth summer! Running Monday through Friday (7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.) from June 15 through August 28, this year&#8217;s camp is open to pre-kindergartners up to seventh graders.</p>
<p>Founded in 1980, Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s Camp conforms to kids—not the other way around. Instead of a rigid structure, Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s gives their summer campers a choice. Instead of teaching kids the typical way, they give them tools and gentle guidance to help them become autodidacts (people who teach themselves). The difference is subtle—and it’s profound. There are a gazillion ways for kids to design a day at Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s Camp. One camper might dive into breadmaking and animation while another flies down a water slide and scores a goal in our inflatable soccer stadium. It’s up to them. Studio options this year include the Animation Studio, the Breadmaking Studio, the Dance Studio, the Music Studio, the Style Studio, and the brand-new Coding Studio.</p>
<p>Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s Camp gives parents flexibility, too! Their plans are designed to grant peace of mind like Raja yoga. You can buy any number of day passes, use them whenever you want, and get an automatic refund for unused passes. If you need the whole summer, they’ve got a membership, too. You don’t even need to tell them when you’re coming. Lunch and materials are included. Now peace of mind can be attained without having to get into a downward dog pose. Namaste.</p>
<p>Visit here for more information about registration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By:  Emily Ge &#8217;15 <br/><br/> Senior Emily Ge &#8217;15 reflects on how serving as a columnist at the Tacoma News Tribune has improved her writing and changed her perspective on the craft as she heads off to college.</p>
<p>Before I first started writing for the Tacoma News Tribune, I hadn&#8217;t really put any thought into what the character of my column would be—I was beyond excited simply to see my name in print every month. Only when my editors at the TNT advised me to set up a second email account for reader responses did it dawn on me that for the first time in my life, I would be writing for more than one person. Tens of thousands of strangers in print and more than a million online would be reading my work. Suddenly the stakes were much higher than a bad grade in English class; people I had never even met would be reacting to words I had written.</p>
<p>Now, almost a year after my first column, I can look back and read my work without too much cringing. The first few columns were rough, but I started to hit my stride when I took more care to develop the topics of my columns; as they became more personal and specific to my life, I could see the risks paying off in my writing. I also began to see a huge spike in reader responses, which was amazing. Now, I get emails and handwritten letters from all kinds of people. One of the most special packages I received in the mail consisted of an assortment of photographs that the letter writer&#8217;s father, a producer on the original Star Trek TV show, had taken with the entire cast. The feedback I receive on the column is fantastic, and I feel incredibly fulfilled that people other than my mom and my English teacher can have an emotional response to my writing. </p>
<p>Almost a year ago, I never could have imagined that my column would be where it&#8217;s at now. I never would have guessed that I would write about everything from my grandparents to Star Trek to Elgar&#8217;s &#8220;Cello Concerto in E Minor&#8221; Without this column, I never could have known just how much I was capable of in my writing. This experience has helped me to understand the perils and joys of writing outside of my comfort zone, and I would definitely not be the writer I am today without it. Whether I&#8217;m writing for myself, the TNT, or for an English teacher, I can truly say that now I am more willing to take risks, and I&#8217;m also more able to write about myself, which is always a challenging task. I know now that no matter what I study in college, writing is something to which I can always return, and furthermore it is something to which I will always want to return. </p>
<p>I am also indebted to the education I have had at Charles Wright; since the very first day of junior kindergarten, I have had teachers who have cheered me on and who have pushed me to grow as a writer and also as a human being. I know now that with every poem, short story, or typed-at-midnight-the-night-before analytical essay, I was taking a step to becoming the writer I am today. The English teachers I&#8217;ve had at CWA have all been extremely different, and each has been exceptional in their own way. They&#8217;ve been alternately wise, kooky, demanding, and mind-blowing, but each has had an indelible imprint on my writing.       My English teachers have never been anything other than supportive; they were the ones who first noticed how much I love to write. They were the ones who lent me volumes of poetry and short-essay anthologies (many of which I have yet to return—I promise I will before I graduate!). They were the ones who gave me the confidence to even consider submitting my work to the TNT in the first place.</p>
<p>To every teacher, English and otherwise, whom I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of encountering at Charles Wright: a resounding thank you from the depths of my being! What would I have done without you? More importantly, who would I have been without you? (Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not ending an essay with a rhetorical question—or am I?) Most of all, thank you for teaching me the rules and then for letting me break them, for showing me that the power of story means more than adverb clauses and thesis statements. Marcel Proust once said, &#8220;the voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes&#8221; Thank you for lending me your glasses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By:  Joe Boyle <br/><br/> More than $130,000 was raised for the 2015 Spirit Auction Fund-A-Need, the Phyllis M. Boyle Student Opportunity Fund. This new endowed fund will live in perpetuity and support Tarriers for generations to come as a resource that provides support to students so they may fully experience all that CWA has to offer and realize their full potential. Donations to this endowment fund will help to cover the costs for books, Winterim travel, athletic gear, and other expenses so that every Tarrier can experience a CWA education on more even footing. Below, read Joe Boyle&#8217;s firsthand account of his mother&#8217;s inspiring life.</p>
<p>My mother&#8217;s name is Phyllis Mary Boyle. She was born on Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day in 1922—93 years ago. One would hope that being born on a day full of traditionally jovial celebration would be a good omen, but that wasn&#8217;t the case for my mom. Her early years were unfortunately marked with neglect and even outright abuse, primarily at the hands of her mother. Her stories of strength and survival have now inspired three successive generations of the Boyle family and countless others to be resilient—and, above all, to value love and inclusion.</p>
<p>To look at one of the few photos of my mom that was taken during her adolescence would be to know she was a beautiful young woman. She had a vibrant spirit to match, but it was tamped down by prolonged emotional, mental, and physical cruelty doled out by not only her mother, but also her father and older brothers. While her brothers rode the trolley to school, wore uniforms, and ate hot lunches, my mother was made to walk to school in ragged hand-me-downs and eat lard on bread. Her mother would grab her hair and bang her head against the wall, lock her in a closet for prolonged periods, and constantly tell her she was ugly and that nobody would ever love her.<br />
Luckily my grandmother was wrong—about everything. My mom dropped out of high school her sophomore year and found a job as a waitress at Hilltop Caf&eacute; on Capitol Hill in Seattle. While my grandmother took most of her earnings, my mom still felt a sense of escape from the pain she experienced at home and at school. Then, her luck truly changed: She met a dashing young man named William E. Boyle at a church gathering held at her house. They married in 1942 and later had me and then my sister, Peg.</p>
<p>My mom broke the cycle. Peg and I grew up in a loving home where a nurturing environment was prized above all else. Education was also highly valued. My mother did a good job of hiding the fact that she was a high-school dropout, but for most of her life she looked over her shoulder for fear of someone discovering her dark secret of what she thought was scholastic failure. But Peg and I both went on to graduate from college. Peg has a master&#8217;s degree in social work and a divinity degree, and she was the founding director of the Mercer Island Family and Youth Service. She served in that capacity for 30 years, providing the kind of help to children our mom so desperately needed when she was growing up. She&#8217;s now a minister for a Unitarian Church in West Seattle. I&#8217;ve always been an entrepreneur, getting involved in business when I was 11 by running my own paper route and lawn-mowing business. I went on to get my degree in business and had a second career as a Pierce County deputy sheriff, spending more than 20 years helping others and being a resource for people in need. It&#8217;s safe to say that our mother&#8217;s selflessness influenced Peg and me greatly.</p>
<p>When my daughter, Paige (Boyle) Evers &#8217;90, came of school age, I had no doubt that I would support the importance of education, rather than undermine her educational opportunities as my grandmother had done with my mother. &#8220;The CWA community encouraged me to strive for excellence while keeping a sense of humor along the way&#8221; recalls Paige, who now lives in Delaware after having graduated from Bryn Mawr College, worked in Japan, and earned a Master of Divinity at Luther Seminary. &#8220;Now that I&#8217;m a pastor and a parent, I find much joy in passing on a love of learning to my own children and to the people I serve in my congregation and in the community. While I was growing up, my grandma always supported my education. She took an interest in the opportunities I seized, even though they were so different from her own path&#8221;. </p>
<p> Long story not so short, our family understands that children don&#8217;t start out on an even playing field. Being members of the CWA family has been an honor and a privilege. But that privilege comes with a price, and there are many aspects of our school&#8217;s phenomenal program that require extra funds in order to participate. That&#8217;s why our family founded the Phyllis M. Boyle Student Opportunity Fund last year. We hope to turn the dark days of my mother&#8217;s childhood into something bright and promising for current and future Tarriers. Donations to this endowment fund—which was the 2015 Spirit Auction&#8217;s Fund-A-Need—will help to cover the costs for books, Winterim travel, athletic gear, and other expenses so that every Tarrier can experience a CWA education on more even footing. Paige says she is &#8220;grateful this endowment fund will allow students to experience all CWA has to offer and to help them become lifelong learners, wherever their journey takes them.&#8221;</p>
<p> Our family has seen firsthand that CWA students are blessed with an opportunity to live, grow, learn, and prosper along a pathway that can lead them toward reaching their full potential. My mother has two children, three grandchildren, and soon-to-be three great-grandchildren who adore her and who have all experienced what it is to live in a loving home and receive a quality education. We hope to share this joy with as many generations of Tarriers as possible. Please consider joining us on this journey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <br/><br/> In 2006 Chess4Life founder and national master Elliott Neff began teaching lessons in the Charles Wright Academy Lower School Chess Club. We spoke with Mr. Neff about his love of chess and memories as a coach and mentor to Tarriers, including 2015 Washington state champion Noah Fields &#8217;18. To learn more about the Chess Club and Noah, click here. </p>
<p>As a &#8220;mostly self-taught&#8221; chess player, what sparked your interest in chess?<br />
I played chess since I can remember—my dad taught me the moves early on. I can remember playing over the moves from the Fisher-Spassky 1972 world championships and being completely puzzled as to why Fisher resigned when he did in his first game—I couldn&#8217;t understand at that time why! My first tournament was when I was 8 years old. I had never used a chess clock or chess timer before, and that tournament was what really sparked my keen interest in pursuing chess. That tournament, followed by a few more tournaments over the next few years, solidified my sense that I really could become very good in chess. I wanted to be champion and pursued it avidly from that time on through high school.</p>
<p>What has kept you so motivated to succeed?<br />
I am somewhat competitive, and I worked hard to try to become the high school state champion—and succeeded while a junior in high school. Then I kept setting additional stretch goals to improve my chess, mostly focusing on what effort I needed to put in. Hence, I felt successful no matter how I did in tournaments because I was committed to putting in the study necessary to improve. I learned early on the concept of, &#8220;Win, Draw, Learn!&#8221; that we teach today in Chess4Life—the concept of seeing failures and losses as learning opportunities.<br />
What do you enjoy most about teaching chess? Why is chess such a valuable game for children to learn?<br />
I love seeing the light bulb go on as students understand and grasp new concepts and then apply them. What motivates me for the long haul is seeing students apply the lessons we teach to their life as a whole, not just in chess. Chess is uniquely valuable because of intrinsic benefits that come from learning, studying, and practicing the game—skills including memory, concentration, strategic planning, and many more that fit with STEM education initiatives. Additionally, our focus at Chess4Life is to help the students improve in their character, cognitive, cooperative, and leadership skills. I see them improving in decision making and goal setting that tells me they are learning the skills necessary to succeed and flourish in life, not just get by. I love to see them progress; I don&#8217;t worry about them being perfect.</p>
<p>What do you recall from your time at CWA in terms of the school&#8217;s chess culture? What do you think makes CWA&#8217;s Chess Club unique?<br />
I have loved coaching personally at CWA for multiple years as well as continuing to work with CWA to provide what CWA is looking for. I love the inclusiveness and team spirit at CWA as well as the culture of mentoring others—those students who are more advanced regularly help others who are not so far advanced. What makes CWA&#8217;s Chess Club unique in my opinion really goes back to the leadership at CWA who have striven to, and I believe succeeded in, developing a culture of &#8220;can-do&#8221; attitude versus an attitude of &#8220;we&#8221; versus &#8220;me&#8221; and an attitude of excellence both personally and academically.</p>
<p>What do you admire most about Noah and his approach to chess?<br />
 While I was involved only a little bit with coaching Noah in class early on at CWA, I&#8217;ve observed more from a distance. Noah has always appeared to me to be a student who focuses, strives hard, does not do things halfway, sets goals, and does his best.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite chess memory—as a player, a teacher, or an observer?<br />
That&#8217;s a question that is hard to answer because of so many memories: winning for the first time against my great uncle while just 8 years old, winning my first time attempting to play chess blindfolded (against my dad), and defeating my first grandmaster in the U.S. Open Chess Championships are high up there, as is drawing against the world chess champion Anand in a simul in 2012. However, I think my most rewarding memories come as a teacher, when I had a student who for three years played in tournaments and attended classes faithfully and never won a single game, even in practice—and didn&#8217;t even manage a draw! If he had a winning game, he somehow managed to get checkmated. I thought he would give up but worked really hard to keep encouraging him, and one day in a chess tournament where he was always losing all five games, he managed to get a stalemate (a draw in chess). You would have thought he had just won the tournament! That was the turning point for him. The very next tournament, he won three out of five, qualified for the state championships, and competed well there also! Seeing that breakthrough was just awesome, as I saw him come to realize that he really could achieve if he simply persisted and never gave up!</p>
