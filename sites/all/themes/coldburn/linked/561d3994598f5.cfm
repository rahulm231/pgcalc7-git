This year's graduates will attend schools across the United States, including many of the top music programs in the country.</p><p> "This is such an important moment for our students," said Music Academy Dean Ory Shihor. "All the work they've put into their time at the Music Academy helped prepare them for this next step in their music education." </p><p>The Music Academy's program prepares talented pre-college musicians for conservatory-level training and careers as well-rounded musicians. The curriculum includes classes in music theory, chamber music, music history, and presentational skills, as well as private lessons. Many students have the opportunity to take master classes with visiting faculty. Last year's guest artists included violinist Laurent Korcia, violist Kim Kashkashian, and cellist Hans J&#248;rgen Jensen.</p><p>Eleven students graduated from the Music Academy this year and will continue to develop their artistry at the Colburn Conservatory of Music, The Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute of Music, the Peabody Institute at The Johns Hopkins University, the University of Southern California, DePaul University, and the University of Michigan.</p><p>"All of the experiences I've had at the Colburn Music Academy have allowed me to grow as a musician and a performer, to take what I've accomplished in the practice room out onto the stage," said recent graduate Hannah Geisinger, a violist who will study at Juilliard in the fall. "This has been a groundbreaking experience for me."</p><p>As they reflect on their time at the Music Academy and prepare to move forward, these Colburn alumni have important advice for prospective students. "There's so much you can do with your time at the Colburn School and in Los Angeles," said violist Lauren Siess, also attending Juilliard this fall. "There are so many opportunities. Take advantage of all of them.</p><p>"We are so proud of our graduates and wish them all the best as they move forward," Mr. Shihor said.</p><p>A complete list of graduates and their destinations follows.</p><p>Cellist Katrina Agate, undecided at press time<br> Bassist Nicholas Arrendondo, Colburn Conservatory of Music<br> Clarinetist Wonchan Doh, The Juilliard School<br> Pianist Yi-Chen Feng, Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University<br> Violist Hannah Geisinger, The Juilliard School, Kovner Fellow<br> Violist Mya Greene, University of Southern California<br> Cellist Oliver Herbert, Curtis Institute of Music<br> Violinist Alina Kobialka, DePaul University<br> Violist Lauren Siess, The Juilliard School, Kovner Fellow<br> Violinist Yu Chao Weng, University of Michigan<br> Violinist Mei Zhan, Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/AcademyVirtuosiApr2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>Clarinetist Wonchan Doh, who studies with Yehuda Gilad, and cellist Oliver Herbert, who studies with Clive Greensmith, will perform solos as part of the </span><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5203">final Academy Virtuosi concert of the season on April 28.</a><span> Both students are in their senior year at the Colburn Music Academy.</span></p><p> The soloists were selected in the first annual Music Academy Concerto Competition, held in December. Current students auditioned for a committee of Music Academy faculty members in order to clinch the soloist spot for the spring semester Academy Virtuosi concert. The Academy Virtuosi is the Music Academy's conductorless chamber orchestra.</p><p>"We all felt this was an enriching opportunity for the students to experience what it is like to lead and perform a concerto without a conductor," said faculty member Margaret Batjer, who coaches the Academy Virtuosi. "We originally intended to have only one soloist, but at the audition there were clearly two students, Oliver and Wonchan, who were exceptional and deserved that opportunity."</p><p>Oliver will perform a Vivaldi concerto at Tuesday's performance, while Wonchan will perform the Stamitz clarinet concerto. "The chamber orchestra is also performing a wonderful Mendelssohn string symphony and Mozart's Adagio and Fugue, which they are playing so beautifully," Ms. Batjer added.</p><p>The concert will be Oliver and Wonchan's last performance as students of the Colburn Music Academy. In the fall, Wonchan will begin studies at the Juilliard School in New York City. Oliver will attend the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. "They are both highly gifted musicians at this young age," Ms. Batjer said, "and having the opportunity to solo with the Academy Virtuosi will be a celebratory captstone to their Music Academy experience."</p><p>Music Academy Dean Ory Shihor agreed. "It has been a pleasure to work with Oliver and Wonchan. I expect great things from them in the future, and wish them all the very best in the next stage of their education."</p>]]></description>

Six pianists advanced to the semifinals and only three to the final round. Considered one of the major competitions for young pianists in the United States, the judges evaluate each contestant on elegance, quality, and style.</p><p>Started in 1978 as a segment of a piano conference at the College of the Desert, the competition draws talented pianists from across the world to compete in solo and concerto rounds for juniors, age 12 and younger; intermediates, ages 13&#8211;17; and seniors, ages 18&#8211;35. It has been known as the Virginia Waring International Piano Competition since 2001, honoring the successful professional pianist who has supported the competition for many years.</p><p>The competition's goal is to provide young pianists through age 32 with performance opportunities. Contestants participate in both solo and concerto rounds as well as master classes in each age category. Winners have earned performance opportunities in Vienna, London, Rome, San Francisco, and Carnegie Hall in New York.</p>]]></description>

The Colburn School's program is unique because it emphasizes the importance of performance preparation, including special workshops and classes on presentation skills as well as numerous opportunities for public recitals. </p><p>"Our students find it very refreshing to be surrounded by peers who are as passionate and dedicated to their art as they are," said Music Academy Dean Ory Shihor. "Our school is an important environment for them. They can be themselves here. They can grow into accomplished adult musicians here."</p><p>Applicants must <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2414">submit an online application form</a> and $75 application fee to be considered for the Music Academy. Along with the formal application, prospective students must submit a digital prescreening video, along with a list of prior public performances, scholarships or prizes won, and a list of memorized solo repertoire, and a letter of recommendation from a professional musician.</p><p>Students selected to move on in the process will audition on May 1. This in-person audition gives faculty members important impressions about a student's readiness for study in the Music Academy's advanced program.</p><p>Some Music Academy students attend classes as day students, while others live on campus in the Colburn School residences in downtown Los Angeles. Students can opt to enroll in a nearby school or take classes online in order to complete their high school studies.</p><p>"It's a wonderful opportunity for a young musician," Mr. Shihor said. "The chance to dedicate one's self to fully to art at such a young age has a transformational effect on our musicians.

This year's festival will highlight piano concerto literature as its centerpiece, allowing students to explore the defining characteristics of concertos through private lessons, master classes, lectures, performances, and theoretical studies.</p><p>Six finalists from among the entrants will advance to the Steinway Concerto Competition's final round. The first prize winner, selected from these finalists, will receive the $1,500 Steinway Prize and be presented in the Pasadena Symphony's 2016&#8211;2017 Classics Series at the Ambassador Auditorium with Music Director David Lockington.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/Home_Page_Banners/AcademyConcert_2015.jpg"><br></p><p>"Today's musicians must be able to speak freely, with confidence, about themselves, the music, and to answer questions and engage with the audience," said Ory Shihor, dean of the Music Academy. For that reason, the music academy established regular Young Artist Performances to give prepared students the opportunity to appear on stage, not only to perform works, but to practice their stage presence skills.<br></p><p>Young Artist Performances happen twice monthly and give eight to 10 students the opportunity to perform. Music academy students present either a solo piece or play as part of a chamber ensemble. In order to be included in the program, however, students must apply and be approved by their instructor for consideration. </p><p>"Our students share a common dream of becoming professional musicians and are eager to share their love and passion for music with others," Mr. Shihor said. "They all work hard and can't wait to get on stage to perform."</p><p>The pre-college students of the music academy show incredible promise for a successful music career. Beyond the thrill of being on stage, students learn practical skills for their future. "Young musicians are seldom taught how to 'behave' on stage," Mr. Shihor explained, "including how to bow, how to dress, or even how to smile and make eye contact with the audience. All of this is just sort of expected of them."</p><p>To Mr. Shihor's knowledge, the music academy's class on presentation skills is the only one of its kind for young musicians. It is taught by lauded drama educator Debbie Devine.</p><p>Young Artist Performances also help students prepare for another significant career rite of passage: competitions and concerts outside the Colburn School campus. </p><p>The best part, Mr. Shihor says, is watching the students support and care for each other leading up to the performances. "You often see them encouraging each other backstage prior to performing," he said. "It is truly heartwarming to see."</p><p> The next Young Artist Performance will be Saturday, February 7. <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5470" target="_blank">Visit our website</a> for more information.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/MC_KimKashkashianJan2015o_(2).jpg"><br></p><p>Among orchestral stringed instruments, the viola seems one of the most neglected by classical composers when considering existing solo repertoire&#8212;but all that will change if master violist Kim Kashkashian has anything to say about it.<br></p><p>In the early years of her career, Ms. Kashkashian came to realize she had many more opportunities to play works for viola in Europe than in America. In 2000, she explained the situations to <i>Strings </i>magazine: "Here, the viola is just beginning to be reluctantly respected as a solo instrument, while in Europe it is fully accepted." </p><p>In the late 1980s, she moved to Germany to pursue those opportunities and stayed for 13 years. However, an opportunity to teach with the New England Conservatory, where she remains on faculty, enticed her to come home. But the situation for the viola in America had not improved much. She remarked at the time, "American violists are still acting like missionaries and it's time for me to join the fight."</p><p>Ms. Kashkashian is counted among the most ardent advocates for the expansion of viola repertoire. Along with furthering viola technique, she has personally commissioned new solo and chamber works by many of the top contemporary composers. She relishes the opportunity to perform new work. "I feel that part of my job as a musician is to tell the news, to spread the word about what's going on in the musical world. It's our obligation, as well as a challenge and a pleasure, to work with the composers of the day." </p><p>Her advocacy and passion for new music was honored in 2013 with a Grammy award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo Album, featuring work by Hungarian composers Gyorgy Kurtag and Gyorgy Ligeti. The award energized violists everywhere. </p><p>"Kim Kashkashian is renowned for her interpretations of contemporary music," said Helen Callus, viola instructor in the Music Academy. "Her knowledge of this particular repertoire will be an invaluable experience for the students performing in her master class."</p><p>As a teacher, Ms. Kashkashian strives to impart both effective technique with artistic mastery. "The relationship between student and teacher is very personal, so it's important for a good partnership that we choose each other," she has said. </p><p>At the Colburn School, Ms. Kashkashian will work with music academy and conservatory students as part of a public master class.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5362" target="_blank"> Music Academy Master Class</a></p><p>January 15, 7 pm</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606" target="_blank">Conservatory of Music Master Class</a></p><p>January 16, 6 pm</p>]]></description>

"But you can't just play in your living room. You have to get out into the world. That's why they're here, to try out their material on audience."</p><p>Thirteen students were nominated by music academy faculty members for fall recital auditions. Nominations recognize the hardest working and most accomplished students of the term, with a panel of audition judges choosing the seven students or ensembles who will perform in the recital.</p><p>Performing involves more than just what the audience sees on stage. Music academy students work closely with faculty member Debbie Devine, an acting and presentational speaking coach, to learn about stage presence and public speaking. At the recital, each musician will talk to the audience about his or her relationship the piece to be performed, why it spoke to them, and what it means to them. Mr. Shihor noted there are many choices musicians make when performing, right down to what they'll wear on stage. Every step of it, he said, "is a kind of ritual" for the performer.</p><p>Mr. Shihor hopes the recital performers will feel the energy and appreciation of the audience, which inspires them to keep working hard. He believes performances like this are essential professional development opportunities for music academy students. "It's a critical part of their education, right down to the camaraderie among the performers for the concert."</p><p>The Music Academy Fall Recital will begin at<a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5460"> 5:30 pm on Saturday, December 13</a>.

He was educated at the Conservatoire National Sup&#233;rieur de Musique in Paris, where he studied with Ivo Malec, G&#233;rard Grisey, and Betsy Jolas. </p><p>"Eric is an exceptional composer," Ms. Kreston said. "Since he himself is a violinist, his work feels to me to be particularly well suited for the instrument, so our class is really fortunate to be able to learn from him in person."</p><p>Among Mr. Tanguy's compositions are many pieces for featuring violin, including the stand out <i>Sonata breve</i> for solo violin. Three of Ms. Kreston's students, Geneva Lewis, Sarah Kuo, and Hao Zhao will each perform one movement of that work. Mr. Tanguy has already worked with the three students on the sonata; afterward, he will speak to the class and audience about his work.</p><p>Ms. Kreston teaches in both the community school and the music academy. She welcomes other Colburn School students and parents to join them for this unique conversation. <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/lburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=6189" target="_blank">The student performance</a> will begin at 11 am in Mayman Recital Hall on December 7.<strong></strong></p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Colburn Music Academy Students Shine in Unique Conductorless Performance]]></title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/p_MusicAcademy6194m.jpg"><br></p><p>The tradition of the conductorless orchestra stretches back to the very beginning of symphony history. The earliest orchestras were led by a concertmaster, often the harpsichordist or violinist, who initiated the ensemble's performances. Composers served as the earliest conductors, but the role evolved over time into the professional music director common today.</p><p> The Music Academy's string ensemble of talented pre-college musicians, the Academy Virtuosi, is a continuation of the orchestra's earliest heritage. Like those early orchestras, though, the Academy Virtuosi work with a professional concertmaster, Margaret Batjer of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, who guides them in a coaching role through the special challenges of conductorless performance. "They have to learn to use their ears in a very sophisticated way," Ms. Batjer said. "Each member of the section from first to last chair has a much greater responsibility than when there is a conductor."</p><p>For the Academy Virtuosi, the opportunity to play under these circumstances is both empowering and educational. "It's a rare opportunity for students their age to play in an orchestra without a conductor," said Ory Shihor, dean of the Music Academy. "I don't know of many programs where young musicians get to perform this way."</p><p> Ms. Batjer draws from expertise gleaned from her mentors when she was a student and the wealth of experience developed at the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. "I have worked with the students over the past 10 weeks on this program," she said. "Aubree, from the Concertmaster chair, as well as the other principals, have learned to lead the ensemble themselves physically and also musically by example. They have come so far in terms of understanding the nature of a conductorless ensemble as well as growing musically and technically with the program."</p><p>The Academy Virtuosi performance on Tuesday, November 25 will include selections from Vivaldi, Handel, Bach, Elgar, and Bart&#243;k. "Working with young musicians is one of my greatest passions," Ms. Batjer said. "Although I only began my work with the Virtuosi this year, I have seen such growth in all of them individually and collectively. I have enjoyed working with all of them very much."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5202">Visit our website</a> for more information on this event. </p>]]></description>
