The concert's program will feature prominent horn soloists from around the world, including members of the Berlin Philharmonic and the United States Army Band.<span></span></p><p> "The opportunity for the Wind Symphony musicians to play with these international artists is really such a special moment for them," said Dr. Nathaniel Zeisler, who directs the Colburn School's community engagement programs. "I'm grateful for our collaboration with the International Horn Symposium and hope our symphony musicians have a wonderful time performing with these guests."<span></span></p><p> The program for Saturday's concert includes works by Strauss, Saint-Sa&#235;ns, Graziani, and Grainger, along with world premieres of Wingspan by Gary Kuo and Blockbuster by Adrian Hallan. Horn soloists include Dale Clevenger, Yuta Igawa, Peter Luff, Jeffrey Nelson, Arkady Shilkloper, Denise Tyron, and the Colburn School's Andrew Bain.

Dennis Zeisler, Chair of the Music Department at Old Dominion University, serves as the group's music director and conductor.<span></span></p><p>The Adult Wind Symphony performance is free and open to the public. <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.ihsla2015.com/" target="_blank">Visit ihsla2015.com</a> for complete information on this event.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/ColburnCommunityChoraleApr2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>On April 25, the adult singers of the Colburn Community Chorale will appear with student vocalists from the Colburn Concert Choir, the Colburn Chamber Singers, and the Colburn Young Men's Chorus. The concert is led by Choir Director Dr. Mikhail Shtangrud and features pianist Pepron Pilibossian.</p><p>Each ensemble has a unique focus and fosters musical and artistic development through rehearsals and the study of vocal works. The Community Chorale attracts adult singers committed to learning and performing sophisticated repertoire, meeting weekly to rehearse for 13 weeks each semester. "I hope the chorale members find a community of singers who share their love for fine choral music," Dr. Shtangrud said, "and enjoy their pursuit of artistic excellence in the beautiful environment of the Colburn School."</p><p>Saturday's concert is an opportunity for all the vocalists to perform in the Colburn School's famed Zipper Hall, recently included on a list of the 50 most beautiful conservatories and schools of music, considered to be acoustically one of the best performance spaces in Los Angeles. </p><p>This is Dr. Shtangrud's first year directing the Community Chorale, though he's worked with the Colburn School's other ensembles for ten years. The central work in the Community Chorale's performance will be <i>Mass of the Children</i> by John Rutter. "The Community Chorale members have a great passion for music and make every choir rehearsal a true joy," Dr. Shtangrud said. "I love working with them." The Colburn School's Community Chorale program, now in its third year, has performed an array of major works by Haydn, Faur&#233;, and Whitacre, and has performed with the Colburn Youth Orchestra and Colburn Chamber Orchestra as well. Auditions for the Community Chorale's 2015&#8211;2016 season will be held by appointment in May and early September.</p><p>Of the other ensembles on the program, the Concert Choir is the largest, made up of high school and junior high school vocalists. The Chamber Choir is the smallest, with only a few vocalists performing each part. The Young Men's Chorus gives teen boys an opportunity to explore the existing repertoire for their voices. </p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5223" target="_blank">Visit our online calendar</a> for more information on this event.</p>]]></description>
