		<title><![CDATA[SongFest Highlights Suppressed Composers through Ziering-Conlon Initiative Collaboration]]></title>
		<link>http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2426&amp;newsid=1108</link>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/SongFest.jpg"></p><p>Each spring, SongFest takes up residence at the Colburn School, and on June 7, the art song festival and training program will present a concert in collaboration with Colburn's Ziering-Conlon Initiative entitled Rediscovering Vocal Gems of the Early 20th Century. The concert, which begins at 4 pm in Thayer Hall, features SongFest participants and Colburn Conservatory of Music students and alumni instrumentalists.<br></p><p>"Almost immediately after the creation of the Ziering-Conlon Initiative, Sel Kardan suggested I be in touch with SongFest," said Robert Elias, director of the Ziering-Conlon Initiative for the Colburn School. "He felt SongFest, with their wide range of repertoire interests, might welcome a collaboration, and he was right."</p><p>SongFest is the United States's premier art song festival and training program held each summer at the Colburn School in Los Angeles. The event provides young singers and pianists with training and performance opportunities with the most distinguished artists in their field by fostering a supportive, challenging, and rewarding musical environment.</p><p> Liza Stepanova, an associate artistic director of SongFest, contacted Mr. Elias and with early input from LA Opera Music Director James Conlon, Stepanova devised a program to highlight the work of composers suppressed by the Nazi regime. "These composers would be much better known today had they not been banned from publication, broadcasting, and performance during the twelve years of the Nazi regime," Mr. Elias said. "The history of classical music in the first half of the 20th century is terribly incomplete as a result."</p><p> The composers selected for inclusion in the SongFest program share a common lineage. "They all were an integral part of the Austro-German classical music tradition, a tradition that stretches all the way back to before Bach," Mr. Elias explained. "There is no comparable artistic tradition of consistent excellence anywhere in the history of Western culture, whether in music or visual art."</p><p> A major goal of the Ziering-Conlon Initiative is to place this music in the ears, hands, and ultimately the repertoire of today's and tomorrow's musicians so they may come to know the music and perform it regularly for audiences.</p><p> "SongFest is thrilled about this partnership," Ms. Stepanova said. "Our participants will benefit enormously from exposure to this repertoire, much of which will be unfamiliar to them. Our hope is that they'll go home inspired and continue programming and exploring these works as their careers move forward." As part of SongFest's preparation for the event, they reached out to Professor Timothy Cheek, a foremost expert on Czech lyric diction and repertoire, to help with the preparation of works by Pavel Haas, Gideon Klein, and V&#237;t&#283;zslava Kapr&#225;lov&#225;. Mark Trawka, director of musical studies at Pittsburgh Opera, will conduct Gideon Klein's Madrigal, a haunting ensemble work composed at the Terezin concentration camp. </p><p> "We are particularly excited about this first official collaboration between our vocalists and alumni instrumentalists of the Colburn Conservatory," Ms. Stepanova added. "Chamber music and art song were once much more integrated in concert life, but now are often too separate. We hope this is the beginning of an ongoing partnership."</p><p> Rediscovering Vocal Gems of the Early 20th Century is free, though reservations are required.

"I still prefer the very first version of it, a young man's excited, luxurious, wasteful orchestration, as he himself used to call it," he said. "If you have to choose the five most exciting minutes in all of music, this is certainly high up on the list." </p><p>Mr. Salonen, who served as music director for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1992 to 2009 and is now its Conductor Laureate, was the first conductor to lead performances at the now-famous Los Angeles architectural landmark on Grand Avenue, leading a program that included another monumental work by Stravinsky, <i>The Rite of Spring</i>. </p><p>"For our students, working with the very conductor who inaugurated Walt Disney Concert Hall represents a pivotal moment for them as they develop into professional musicians," said Colburn School President and CEO Sel Kardan. "It's a valuable experience I know they'll cherish."</p><p>The April 24 concert is part of the Colburn School's 2015 Colburn School gala, "Grand Avenue in Grand Style," which celebrates the evolution of the downtown cultural corridor into a vibrant center of artistic and creative innovation reminiscent of Paris in 1910, where Stravinsky debuted <i>The Firebird</i>. This year's gala honorees include Mr. Salonen, celebrated for his artistic contributions to Los Angeles, as well as philanthropists Edythe and Eli Broad, whose support of Grand Avenue arts institutions have ensured those organizations will thrive well into the next century and beyond. The Broad museum, opening in the fall of this year, will become a treasured addition to Grand Avenue and a welcome neighbor to both the Colburn School and Walt Disney Concert Hall.</p><p>Under the direction of Music Director and Conductor Yehuda Gilad, the Colburn Orchestra has performed for Southern California audiences at venues such as Walt Disney Concert Hall, Ambassador Auditorium, Royce Hall, Segerstrom Concert Hall, and the Valley Performing Arts Center. Mr. Gilad and the esteemed faculty of the Colburn Conservatory of Music invited Mr. Salonen to guest conduct the orchestra and are thrilled by the opportunity our students have to work with such a celebrated conductor.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://sa1.seatadvisor.com/sabo/servlets/TicketRequest?eventId=949465&amp;presenter=COLBURN&amp;venue=&amp;event=&amp;version=" target="_blank">Visit this link</a> to buy tickets.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/ArnoldSteinhardtApr2015o.jpg"><br></p><p> "The students at the Colburn School are so gifted, and because they're so gifted, they're receptive to ideas," said violin professor Arnold Steinhardt, who will give a recital on campus on Sunday. "My goal is to open the minds, hearts, and ears of my students so that they are able to broaden and expand their understanding of music."</p><p> Mr. Steinhardt was born in Los Angeles and made his solo debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at age 14. He went on to study with Ivan Galamian at the Curtis Institute of Music and with Joseph Szigeti in Switzerland before launching a successful recital and soloist career. In 1964, he co-founded the Guarneri String Quartet, of which he was a member for the next 45 years. Together, the group made innumerable tours across the globe and recorded dozens of performances for commercial albums.</p><p> Despite his success, Mr. Steinhardt has a refreshingly broadminded view of his career. "I've never had a ten-year, a five-year, or even a one-year plan," he said. "I love the unexpected twists and turns in life, and I always admire that in other people, when they've gone in one direction and swerved away toward something else."</p><p> To that end, Mr. Steinhardt turned to writing, publishing the first of his two books in 1998. He has contributed articles to publications like <i>Chamber Music America, Musical America</i>, and <i>Keynote</i> as well. "I never expected to write regularly about music," he said. "I just sort of fell into it. But writing is a great joy for me." As an ongoing writing project, he established a blog on his website and posts new content monthly. "My son is a web designer and suggested I start a blog when he created my website," Mr. Steinhardt recalled. "I thought I'd have two to three months of ideas for writing, but that was over six years ago." </p><p> Mr. Steinhardt's recital at the Colburn School will feature pieces by Bach, Beethoven, and Sir Edward Elgar. "I'm looking forward to sharing my experience with the audience," he said of the event. "I picked three masterpieces I love," he went on, "and I love working with Vivian Fan, the Colburn School staff pianist."</p><p> <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606">Please visit our online calendar</a> for more information on Arnold Steinhardt's recital. This event is free and open to the public.</p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet Gives Master Class, Talks about His Career]]></title>
		<link>http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2426&amp;newsid=1072</link>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/JeanYvesThibaudetApr2015o.jpg"><span><br></span><img width="1" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/JeanYvesThibaudetApr2015o.jpg">C<span>olburn School Artist-in-Residence Jean-Yves Thibaudet will give a free public master class Monday, April 13 and will talk with Colburn School President and CEO Sel Kardan about his career as an international touring and recording artist at the next Sidley Austin Artspeaks, Wednesday, April 15. Now in the first of three years as the Colburn School's artist-in-residence, Mr. Thibaudet discussed the impact of his own education, and why he believes Los Angeles will continue to be an important place for musicians.</span></p><p>"The guidance of my teachers was everything to me growing up as an artist," Jean-Yves Thibaudet said, speaking over the phone from his home in Los Angeles between tour dates. "I was lucky to have really wonderful teachers."</p><p>Known for his elegant musicality, the French pianist has established himself as an iconic figure both on and off the stage. Mr. Thibaudet has traveled the globe as one of the world's most sought after concert pianists, one with a style distinctly his own.</p><p>For Mr. Thibaudet, teaching represents the continuation of a valuable tradition, passing down valuable lessons from generation to generation. "One of my teachers was a collaborator of Ravel, and he gave me amazing information about playing his music," he recalled. "If you do not continue to pass these practices along to the new generation of artists, they'll disappear."</p><p>At the same time, having a strong foundation and an understanding of the fundamentals is only half of the journey, according to Mr. Thibaudet. The second part&#8212;of equal importance&#8212;is helping students find their own voice. "A mentor of mine, a concert pianist himself, told me that the most important role of a teacher is to help students find their own personality and identity to reveal in the music," he said. </p><p>While he aims to enrich students by offering his musical insights, he has also found teaching serves his own playing as he continues to develop as an artist. "I've realized I must ask students questions I no longer ask myself. When a student asks, 'How are you doing that?' you learn more about your own playing." </p><p>Mr. Thibaudet's collaborative and good-spirited nature help him build and maintain relationships in the field. "As a soloist, the relationship with the conductor is of greatest importance, and people don't always understand that. Playing with an orchestra is very much like chamber music: you have to listen."</p><p>An inspiring setting is essential to Mr. Thibaudet. Enticed by the arts scene and the promise of blue skies between tours, he made Los Angeles his permanent home 15 years ago. He sees the city, rich in natural beauty and cultural vibrancy, as the perfect place to create. "Los Angeles is an amazing town that has grown and changed so much," he said. "It is one of the most important cities in the world, and has a lot to offer musically and culturally. I would choose to study here."</p><p>His affinity for Los Angeles greatly informed his decision to take his next steps as a mentor at the Colburn School. His enthusiasm for the school's mission contributed to his decision to become the artist-in-residence. </p><p>"Colburn is a fantastic school. I wanted to be a part of the beautiful environment and develop a lasting relationship."</p><p>Mr. Thibaudet sees his role with young musicians today as an investment that will pay dividends for classical music far into the future. While many worry about the future of the genre, Thibaudet steadfastly believes there is no need to fret.</p><p>"More and more young people are coming to classical music," he observes, "because they are genuinely interested in the experience. I think that is wonderful." </p><p>Please <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5359'">visit our website for more information on Mr. Thibaudet's master class</a> or to <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://sa1.seatadvisor.com/sabo/servlets/EventSearch?presenter=COLBURN&amp;event=AS0415">reserve a free ticket for his Artspeaks appearance</a>.</p><p>Mr. Thibaudet's residency is sponsored in part by the Wells Fargo Foundation, Audre Slater, Raulee Marcus, and Stephen Block.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/MartinCliveApr2015REVo.jpg"></p><p>"It affords me the privilege of experiencing works that are well-known to me through the very fresh eyes of our students, some of whom will be playing these pieces for the first time," said cellist Clive Greensmith, who will perform works by Mozart, Kod&#225;ly, and Brahms alongside violin professor Martin Beaver, viola professor Paul Coletti and students from the Conservatory of Music.</p><p> Mr. Beaver and Mr. Greensmith spent many years playing together as members of the illustrious Tokyo String Quartet, performing as many as 125 concerts in a year. When the quartet's two original members elected to retire in 2013, the quartet disbanded. Mr. Beaver and Mr. Greensmith joined the Conservatory's faculty soon after and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students while maintaining a calmer performing schedule. "To play with the same people every day gives you marvelous support, and a familiarity and bond, and that's a very precious thing," Mr. Greensmith said of the transition. "It's also nice to go to different festivals now, to meet new colleagues, and to play different kinds of music."</p><p> Sunday's concert gives the two musicians an opportunity to serve as chamber music mentors for Colburn School students. "For me, chamber music repertoire represents some of the finest works written by the finest composers," Mr. Beaver said. "The art of playing chamber music is challenging as one is faced with the task of playing with all the skill of a virtuoso soloist while at the same time being very sensitive to the texture of the moment." Mr. Greensmith sees the chamber concert as a unique opportunity to embed pedagogy in the performance. "It's the quickest way to get to the heart of the matter, musically speaking, to play alongside students rather than coaching from the front of the stage."</p><p> The performance's pieces will include a quartet, a quintet, and a sextet. Mr. Greensmith said he and Mr. Beaver took selection of the students very seriously and wanted to ensure they could include the greatest number of students. "Several of our players will be graduating, so this is their last chance to perform on the Zipper Hall stage," he said. "We considered carefully the strengths of each student, and were strategic in finding students we thought would be right for each role."</p><p> In addition to their faculty appointments at the Colburn School and their individual performing careers, Mr. Beaver and Mr. Greensmith have found another way to collaborate together by forming the Montrose Trio with lauded pianist Jon Kimura Parker. The group debuted at the Detroit Chamber Music Society last year and have gone on to perform in Montreal and Washington, DC. Mr. Greensmith is happy to report their touring schedule for the upcoming year will be more extensive, while Mr. Beaver noted the trio is active in commissioning new works for the piano trio genre.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5190" target="_blank">Visit this link</a> to learn more.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/DerekTywomiukMar2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>The upcoming </span><i>Gibson Dunn Rush Hour</i><span> concert will take listeners out on a limb with a presentation of contemporary music highlighting the work of percussion students in the Colburn Conservatory of Music.</span><br></p><p>Featuring works written after 1984, the <i>Musical Mavericks</i> Rush Hour concert will feature excerpts from Piazzolla's <i>Tango Suite</i>, Donatoni's <i>Omar: Part II</i>, Steve Reich's <i>Mallet Quartet</i>, and Mark Carlson's <i>Batik for Violin and Piano</i>. The program also features an original composition by Conservatory of Music percussion student Derek Tywoniuk, called <i>This Quiet Night</i>.</p><p>Of the composers included on the program, Derek said, "They're all innovators in their own way. All great composers since Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and the like all questioned the rules of their time, and that's a trait that continues to mark great composers. They force audiences and performers to reevaluate everything they do, to push them further."</p><p>Percussion professor Jack Van Geem was one of the faculty members who helped put the program together. "Richard Beene, Dean of the Conservatory, had been wanting something edgy to add to the mix," he said. "He heard the Reich piece and felt it was perfect. We looked for other pieces like it, pieces that were both challenging and comforting for the audience at the same time."</p><p>Contemporary music represents a departure from the assumptions and standards of much of classical music. While classical composers had their own voices, they tended to compose within a shared spirit of their time. "There are more styles, offshoots of other styles, to even group together 20th century music doesn't really encapsulate all of the possibilities that exist," Derek said. The solo repertoire for percussionists has grown over the last 30 years, Derek added, "and the level of performance by percussionists has skyrocketed during that time." </p><p>Of his own composition, Derek said <i>This Quiet Night</i> was inspired in part by his experience spending late nights alone in the Colburn School's practice rooms. The last half of the piece includes a quotation from Bach, several chords Derek has slowed down to elapse over six minutes, played on a variety of percussion instruments. "I'm fascinated by how we experience time," he said, "how the same interval of time can be gone in an instant or can seem to last forever."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5196">Visit our website</a> for more information on the Rush Hour concert.
