		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/GenevaLewisMar2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>Violinist Geneva Lewis, who studies with Aim&#233;e Kreston in the Community School of Performing Arts, recently won the Grand Prize in the Enkor International Music Competition. Greek composer Lina Tonia will write a violin concerto, and as part of her award, Geneva will perform its world premiere.</span></p><p><span></span><span>The Grand Prize also includes digital publishing and distribution of a recording by KNS Classical in Spain, a debut album release from Master Chord Records, two appearances with the Ploie&#351;ti Philharmonic Orchestra in Romania, a concert appearance in Cyprus, and scholarships to attend the LMP European Masterclass in London and the 2016 New Virtuosi Mastercourses and Festivals.</span></p><p>"This award is particularly exciting because of the many wonderful opportunities it will afford Geneva over the next year," said Ms. Kreston. "Geneva will have experiences that are both rare and valuable to a musician her age. Not only is it an honor to receive this award, but it will provide her with a wealth of new experiences from which to learn and grow."<span></span></p><div> The Enkor International Music Competition, now in its third year, bills itself as "the future of the music competition." A global competition leveraging the opportunities of the Internet to bring together both musicians and jurors from across the world, Enkor is one of the few competitions featuring a transparent adjudication and scoring system.</div><p> Geneva will reap the benefits of her prize for most of the next year, traveling, performing, and recording music as part of her win. "I am honored by the decision of the Enkor jury members and grateful for the opportunities I'll have in the next several months," she said. "And I look forward to sharing my experiences throughout the year with the Colburn community."<span></span></p><p> "Geneva is a dedicated and hardworking student, who is greatly deserving of this honor," said Assistant Dean Sara Hiner. "We are so excited for her and proud that she is representing our Colburn Community School."</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/CSPA_HonorsRecitalJan2015o.jpg"></p><p><span><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1655" target="_blank">The Community School of Performing Arts</a> will welcome more young pianists to camp this week when it launches a <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1749" target="_blank">two-week day camp for musicians aged 9&#8211;13</a>. Students will spend the camp engaged in many aspects of piano musicianship in a fun and social atmosphere.</span><br></p><p> Founder Micah Yui said the idea to start the camp was inspired by her students. "I have so many young piano students who go to academic or sports camps, but nothing musical," she said. "I thought this would be a great opportunity for them to really dig into music at a time when they don't have strict demands from school and other activities."</p><p> The camp will include classes and workshops in choir, drama, percussion and rhythm, and duo piano, just to name a few. "I'm hoping the participants see there's more to the piano than just playing the notes," Ms. Yui said. "They need to be complete musicians with a great sense of rhythm, a strong imagination, and a connection with their feelings."</p><p style="text-indent:.5in" rel="text-indent:.5in">Students will also participate in master classes and recitals. Ms. Yui and her co-director Carmina Glicklitch have two field trips planned to enrich the student's experience at camp. A walking tour of the nearby Music Center complex and surrounding areas will end with a picnic, while students will also experience a docent-led tour of the Museum of Contemporary Arts, Los Angeles.</p>The piano is a solitary instrument," Ms. Yui said. "A camp like this brings these young musicians together both artistically and socially so they can develop a strong peer group." While the camp is artistically rigorous and designed to give students a rich and in depth experience, "most importantly, I want them to have a good time," Ms. Yui added.<p></p><p>The inaugural <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1749" target="_blank">Piano Camp</a><span> beings July 20.</span><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em;"><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/CSPA_OrchestraAuditionsJune2015o.jpg"></p><p>The Community School of Performing Arts will hold auditions for the Colburn Youth Orchestra and Colburn Chamber Orchestra, as well as four other ensembles and the Ed and Mari Edelman Chamber Music Institute <strong>June 4&#8211;7 and June 14</strong> on the Colburn School campus.</p><p> The Youth Orchestra is a full orchestra comprising strings, winds, brass, and percussion. They perform standard symphonic repertoire, including newly commissioned works and arrangements created especially for them. The Chamber Orchestra consists only of strings and, like the Youth Orchestra, they perform standard repertoire for their ensemble as well as works commissioned for them, including compositions by current Community School students.</p><p> Maxim Eshkenazy directs both ensembles and also serves as Associate Conductor of the Colburn Orchestra, the Conservatory of Music's flagship ensemble. Both orchestras regularly appear as part of the <i>Sundays Live</i> performance series at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which is also distributed as a podcast by KUSC radio. The Chamber Orchestra debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's <i>Sounds About Town </i>series, and the Community School is currently planning a European tour for the ensemble beginning June 2016. The group plans to perform in cities such as Prague, Budapest, and Vienna as part of their very first tour.</p><p>Both ensembles participate in the Community School's annual Collaboration Concert, which brings together the Community School's orchestras, choirs, ballet, and modern dance students in one spectacular production involving more than 100 students. </p><p> Each year, the Community School's orchestra program holds a concerto competition for students enrolled in the Colburn Youth Orchestra and Colburn Chamber Orchestra. Winners have an opportunity to perform a solo accompanied by one of these ensembles.</p><p> "Ensemble participation is a crucial part of a young musician's development," said Assistant Dean Sara Hiner, "especially for those who are at an advanced level and planning to pursue music in college. The skills learned in a large ensemble like following a conductor, active listening, blending as one unit, as well as the camaraderie, is priceless."</p><p>Auditioning students should prepare a solo concerto, etude, or showpiece without an accompanist to demonstrate their technical and interpretive skills, along with an orchestral except from a prepared list. Students auditioning for the Chamber Orchestra may sight read as part of their process.</p><p> "It is an honor working with such dedicated and talented young musicians as the ones we have here in the Community School," said Orchestra Manager Alexis Luque. "I am looking forward to welcoming new students to our orchestras this fall and helping them to be the best they can be. I could not be more proud of the students in these groups."</p><p> Contact the Community School by phone at 213-621-4548 to schedule an audition time.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 16.5000019073486px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

		<title><![CDATA[Annual Chamber Gala Hits High Notes for End of School Year]]></title>
		<link>http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2426&amp;newsid=1109</link>
		<guid>http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2426&amp;newsid=1109</guid>
		<description><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em;"><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/ChamberMusicGalaMay2015o.jpg"></p><p>The Community School of Performing Arts will hold its annual Chamber Gala on Saturday, June 6. This year's event has been split into two performances to accommodate the number of participating student ensembles. Concerts begin at 2:30 pm and 4 pm in Thayer Hall.</p><p> The Chamber Gala is the culminating performance for students who study in the Ed and Mari Edelman Chamber Music Institute at the Colburn School. "This is an opportunity to showcase all the work they've done this year," said Gina Coletti, who serves as chair of the institute. Each ensemble will perform one or two movements from a longer work.</p><p> Chamber music students were placed into trios, quartets, and quintets at the start of the academic year. Students range in age from 11 to 18 years old. "Chamber music represents community in its most essential forms," Ms. Coletti said. "You have to make sacrifices for the betterment of the group, you have to pull your own weight, you have to be honest with each other," she explained. With only one musician playing each part of the score, it becomes even more critical for the musicians to develop strong communication skills. "It's not about compromise," Ms. Coletti added. "It's really about collaborating to find the best way forward for the benefit of the entire group. They develop strong bonds and become mentors for each other."</p><p> This is Ms. Coletti's first year as the chair of chamber music for the Community School, and her passion for the art is palpable. She sees her role as one that exists to create opportunities for her students, especially when they ask to try something new. "I try to find a way to say yes," she said. "Their best learning comes from their own feeling of ownership and their passion."</p><p> This past spring, two of the Community School's chamber ensembles advanced in the Fischoff Competition, a national chamber music competition held in Indiana each year. The Fenice Quartet advanced to the semifinals, while the Incendium Quartet, who will appear in Saturday's concert, received the gold medal in the junior division of the competition. The Honors Woodwind Quintet, last heard in this semester's Honors Recital, will perform again on Saturday's program as well.</p><p> "I just want the kids to have opportunities to thrive," Ms. Coletti said. "They work so hard, practicing hours every week to get it right. They deserve the best chances for success."</p>  <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606&amp;start=06/29/2015&amp;period=month">The Chamber Gala performances</a> are free and open to the public.<p></p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 16.5000019073486px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/Jazz_Kids_(1).jpg"><br></p><p>Last Saturday, the Community School of Performing Arts bade farewell to 110 students graduating from high school at the annual Senior Recognition Event.</p><p>This year's senior speaker was trombonist Nicholas Lee, who participated in the jazz and orchestra programs in the Community School during his entire high school career as a member of the Colburn Youth Orchestra and the Colburn Jazz Workshop's award-winning Monday Night Band and Big Band. Along with more than 10% of the Community School's graduating class, Nicholas was also enrolled at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. In his speech to the senior class, Nicholas referenced Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford University commencement address in which he spoke about connecting the dots. "I think it relates to the graduating seniors here today," Nicholas said, "especially those who are pursuing a career in the arts." Nicholas went on to say that "It is your parents, programs like Colburn, and your peers that give you more dots to trust, a few more risks to take, and the confidence to follow your heart. You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."</p><p>Half of Nicholas's graduating class will major in music in the fall and 94% will go on to a four-year university or conservatory. Twelve students plan to pursue double majors, seven will be at Ivy League institutions, and 11 will attend a conservatory, including the Colburn Conservatory of Music. Overall, Community School students will be in the freshman class at 63 different institutions in twenty states and three countries.</p><p>"I am so proud of our senior class and their many impressive accomplishments," said Dean Robert McAllister, who led the event with Colburn School President Sel Kardan and Assistant Dean Sara Hiner. "Our students leave with a passion for learning, a drive to succeed, and the commitment to serious study. These are skills they can take with them no matter what professional path they may choose."</p><p> <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

Of the 44 students who participated in nearly seven hours of auditions this month, eight soloists and two ensembles won spots on this semester's recital program.</p><p>The musicians in the spring Honors Recital represent the Community School's strings, piano, winds, and voice departments. In addition to their applied studies, many of them are also enrolled in orchestras, band, choir, chamber ensembles, and music theory classes. "Students such as the ones represented in this recital are fully engaged and committed to achieving their utmost potential," said Dean Robert McAllister, "and their involvement in multiple classes and ensembles allows them to excel to the highest levels."</p><p>Performers range from 14 to 18 years old, hail from both Los Angeles and Orange counties, and come from a variety of backgrounds. "I am proud that our Community School is able to provide top level arts instruction to students from all walks of life," said Assistant Dean Sara Hiner. "Our Honors Recital is a beautiful example of this. The students representing the Community School in this recital come from a variety of neighborhoods and economic backgrounds, attend private schools and public schools, and are enrolled in multiple programs within the Community School." </p><p>Several students in the program are recipients of merit scholarships, financial aid, or are in the Herbert Zipper Scholars program. Now completing its second year, the Herbert Zipper Scholarship provides full scholarship support to dedicated students with high potential and high financial need, for study in the Community School.</p><p>Many of the students performing on the program have garnered a number of honors and wonderful accomplishments this year. </p><p>In the Honors Woodwind Quintet, oboist Enoch Park (age 18) will attend Stanford University, clarinetist Anita Ho (age 17) will attend the University of Michigan, and hornist Brian Jan (age 17) will attend the University of Southern California in the fall. Flutist Roger Justo (age 16) is the recipient of the Sierra Summer Festival's 2015 Horton-Kohl Award, where he will make his solo debut with the Sierra Summer Festival Orchestra this summer.

Pianist Nicholas Mendez (age 16) was a semi-finalist in the Music Center's Spotlight Awards.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/CSPA_HonorsChamberEnsembleatLACMAMay2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>On May 17, students enrolled in the Community School of Performing Arts's Honors Chamber Ensembles will perform at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the <i>Sundays Live </i>performance series, a staple of the city's classical music scene attended by 25,000 people each year and heard by thousands more online.</p><p>The four groups on the upcoming <i>Sundays Live</i> auditioned to become Honors Ensembles, and each student received full scholarships from the Community School to participate in the program. One of the groups, the Incendium Quartet, just returned to Los Angeles after their very exciting gold medal win in the junior division of the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. The Incendium Quartet includes violinists Geneva Lewis and Mei Zhan, violist Emma Wernig, and cellist Atticus Mellor-Goldman.</p><p>"I am so incredibly proud of these students and what they have achieved together," said their chamber music coach Aim&#233;e Kreston. "I knew from the beginning these students had something magical together. It has been an honor to coach them and I am so grateful for all of the support we have received."</p><p>Also on the program is the Honors Woodwind Quintet, coached by Karen Lundgren; the Honors Brass Quintet, coached by Darren Mulder; and the Honors Piano Trio, coached by Jacob Braun.

"The Colburn Community School of Performing Arts is an essential part of that musical legacy. Community School students have performed in LACMA's Bing Theater as a part of <i>Sundays Live</i> during each of those 25 years. And we wouldn't be here today without the participation of the Colburn School for a quarter of a century."</p><p> If you miss Sunday's concert, you can hear the Honors Piano Trio and Honors Woodwind Quintet on the Community School's spring Honors Recital on Sunday, May 31 at 3 pm in Zipper Hall. </p>]]></description>

Performances will feature tap, jazz, and musical theater at 2 pm and 5:30 pm.</p><p> The 2 pm showcase highlights dancers who are 13 years old and younger who have participated in classes in tap, jazz, or musical theater. "With our younger dancers, we start with shorter pieces so they can learn to be on stage and get familiar with the steps," said Denise Scheerer, chair of tap, jazz, and musical theater. The showcase includes a variety of musical styles. "We like to vary the music so it makes for an interesting show," Ms. Scheerer added. "It all melds together so beautifully."</p><p> Joining these students will be dancers from the Apprentice Group, which are among the most advanced dancers in school's tap program. "We want parents to see where continued study of dance can take their children artistically, athletically, and professionally," Ms. Scheerer said.</p><p> The 5:30 pm showcase features primarily high school&#8211;age students who have more dance experience. Dancers include memberes of the Colburn Tap Ensemble and the Apprentice Group, as well as students from the upper level jazz and musical theater courses. The Tap Ensemble will perform two pieces taught to them by guest choreographers Sarah Reich and Steve Zee. Mr. Zee's piece is a premiere performance. The Apprentice Group will dance to the Ray Brown song "Gravy Waltz," while musical theater students will perform selections from <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>42nd Street.</i></p><p> "If you're going to be a musical theater artist, you need to have tap and jazz experience," Ms. Scheerer said. "And if you're tap dancer, you live in the jazz world, though you can tap to anything, really." The overlap and interplay of these forms of music and dance offers students artistic breadth of experience.</p><p> The showcases are a significant moment for these young dancers, some of whom are taking the stage for the first time this semester. Ms. Scheerer said a dancer's training can be challenging, requiring a great deal of focus and practice on a specific piece with one or two opportunities to dance for an audience. "They love to perform," Ms. Scheerer said. "They love to get into costume and onto the stage. It's a benchmark for them, a prize for all their hard work."</p><p> The Children's Dance Showcases are free and open to the public.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259" target="_blank">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

All award recipients will be featured in the magazine's June issue. The awards are considered among the most prestigious honors in jazz education, and Colburn School jazz students are frequently among the recipients. </p><p>"We have had a very nice run in recent years," said Lee Secard, director of the Colburn School's jazz program. "For at least the last four years we have received on average about five or six DownBeat awards per year, which is a remarkable achievement by our students. I am tremendously pleased for their performance success and recognition."</p><p>Winners and outstanding performers receive the honors based on their type of study, and all Colburn School honorees competed in the Performing Arts High School division. In the Jazz Soloist category, tenor saxophonist Max Lesser was awarded Winner for the second year in a row, and drummer Alex Smith was recognized with the Outstanding Performances award. The Thursday Night Band and Monday Night Band received Winner and Outstanding Performances awards, respectively, both under the direction of Lee Secard. </p><p>Luca Mendoza was recognized as Winner for his composition "Ophelia" in the Original Composition&#8212;Small Ensemble category, and in the same category Corey Gordon received the award for Outstanding Composition for "Leaving the Cave." For his arrangement of "A Child is Born," Ethan Moffitt was honored as Winner in the Jazz Arrangement category. Ethan was also interviewed in<i> DownBeat</i>'s segmen, "Young Arrangers Embrace Creativity." Ethan explained to <i>DownBeat</i>, "I'm also a classical double bassist and do a lot of arco, so I wanted something that could mix both worlds." This year's Jazz Arrangement winners comprised three double bassists and a trombonist, most of whom looked to legendary jazz pianist Oscar Peterson for inspiration. Ethan's inspiration for his arrangement of Thad Jones' "A Child is Born" came from an Oscar Peterson recording of the same piece. "I thought there were some really cool voicings in there and that I could maybe pull some out to help me with the horn parts," Ethan told <i>DownBeat</i>. </p><p>"I encourage my students to write," Lee Secard said in the same interview. "My encouragement to Ethan was to stretch out and take some chances. I think he absolutely nailed it."</p><p>"Our program continues to be one of the top training programs for jazz musicians in the nation," said Community School Dean Robert McAllister. "Our faculty understand how to help students move themselves to the next level of playing. They are exceptional musicians."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259" target="_blank">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/CSPA_ChamberOrchestraRehearsalMay2015o.jpg"><br></p><p> The Colburn Chamber Orchestra and Colburn Youth Orchestras will take the stage in <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606" target="_blank">Zipper Hall on May 10 at 4 pm and 7:30 pm </a>respectively. The two ensembles represent the flagship performance ensembles for the Colburn Community School of Performing Arts. Maestro Maxim Eshkenazy serves as music director and conductor for both orchestras.</p><p>"The students will go over some major classical repertoire while they delve into contemporary music, new music, written by someone sitting right next to them. I think that's very inspirational," Mr. Eshkenazy said. "Several of them will get a chance to play a solo with the orchestra for their first time, and that's an experience they'll never forget." </p><p>The chamber orchestra program "has a bit of an Eastern European flair," Mr. Eshkenazy said. They will perform Dvo&#345;&#225;k's beloved <i>Serenade for Strings</i>, an audience favorite the world over. "It's a very technical piece, but it's also very emotional. It's the best that classical and romantic music can offer, in a small package." Also on the program from existing repertoire is Tchaikovsky's <i>Andante Cantabile </i>for string orchestra.</p><p> Mr. Eshkenazy is pleased the chamber orchestra will perform the world premiere of <i>Dear Igor</i> by Community School student Sequoyah Sugiyama, which he composed specifically for this ensemble. "We have performed other pieces by Sequoyah," Mr. Eshkenazy said, "and I think he's an amazing talent with a bright future. His talent goes far beyond his age."</p><p> The youth orchestra program includes Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony in its entirety. Mr. Eshkenazy describes the work as a staple of Russian romanticism. "A lot of people think of this symphony as a purely melodic piece, but it's very advanced rhythmically," he said. "Stravinsky used to say the rhythmic complexity of Tchaikovsky was an inspiration to him, and this piece is a great example of that." The symphony's second movement features one of the biggest solos for French horn in orchestra repertoire. Works by Schumann, Chaminade, and Bruch round out the program and will feature as soloists the winners of the Community School Concerto Competition, cellist Iona Batchelder, flutist Arin Abramovich-Sarkissian, and violinist Abigel Szilagyi.</p><p> Mr. Eshkenazy is grateful to the students in these ensembles for their energy and eagerness to perform their best. "I love their enthusiasm for music," he said. "It's spectacular. I can come back to LA jetlagged, tired, but their dedication to playing well inspires me and recharges me."</p><p> Both concerts are free and open to the public. <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606" target="_blank">Visit our online calendar</a> for more information.<i> </i></p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Joseph Mendoes Faculty Recital Highlights Chamber Works for Cello]]></title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/JosephMendoesApr2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>Community School of Performing Arts cello instructor Joseph Mendoes will give a <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=6242" target="_blank">free public recital on May 1</a> in Thayer Hall on the Colburn School campus. The program will include cello sonatas by Beethoven and Raff, and a trio by Martin&#367; for flute, cello, and piano. "I absolutely love the Beethoven cello sonatas," Mr. Mendoes said. "I performed all of them in a concert in 2010. I feel a special connection to Beethoven's music. He was so effective at creating contrast, going from moments of tremendous violence to moments of rapt beauty, which is on full display in the sonata I will be performing."</span></p><p>Mr. Mendoes will be joined in his performance by pianists Esther Lee and Tae Yeon Lim, as well as his wife, flutist Jaimie Lee Mendoes. "Making music with friends is a joy, and I always love playing chamber music with my wife. Musically, we agree on so many things. It is just too bad there is not much music for cello and flute," he said.</p><p>Mr. Mendoes has been playing cello since fourth grade. His school district was one of only a few in Southern California to offer music education, but he had to choose between choir and strings. "I took home a cello and after just plucking the strings, I was hooked. There haven't been many days since when I haven't played the cello," he said. "I simply love the sound a cello can make." </p><p>As a member of the Colburn School community for many years, he studied cello and chamber music at the Community School with Dr. Richard Naill during his high school years. He was also a member of the Colburn Chamber Orchestra. In 2000, he received a scholarship to study cello at the University of Southern California with Ronald Leonard, and Mr. Mendoes graduated with honors in 2004. During his time at USC, he performed frequently as a member of the Camden String Quartet, which received the Chamber Music Award from USC in 2004. "When I first heard there was an opening at the Colburn School," he said, "I first thought I shouldn't even apply. I had dreamed of teaching here, but it was hard for me to imagine getting the chance." Mr. Mendoes was thrilled to get the position at the Colburn School. "I am so thankful for the opportunity to teach at a world-class music school," he added.</p><p>In addition to his teaching, Mr. Mendoes serves as the Cello Expert for Virtual Sheet Music, an online resource for students, where he has published many educational videos about cello technique and musicianship. </p>]]></description>

The roundtable will focus on the importance of quality, sophisticated theater for young audiences to contribute to healthy children and healthy communities.</p><p> "Theater has the power to broaden the horizons of young minds almost indelibly," Ms. Devine said. "When we introduce children to the magic of live theater, they engage personally with the stories presented to them and can develop essential emotional skills like empathy, compassion, and cross-cultural understanding."</p><p> Schools in the Los Angeles area have been invited to attend student-only matinees from April 28 to May 1, preceding the public performances that weekend.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/SummerCampApr2015o.jpg"><br></p><p> The Community School of Performing Arts will add five new camps to its roster of summer offerings this year, bringing the number of summer camps to nine.</p><p> New dance camps will cover ballet choreography, tap for children, intensive modern dance, and tap for teens. Returning dance camps explore musical theater and tap.</p><p>"It may be summer vacation, but the Colburn School campus remains busy each year with a variety of summer camps, workshops, and intensives," said Community School Dean Robert McAllister. "There are programs for students as young as age 9 to try out something they may have never done before. And opportunities for our most advanced students to brush up on their skills and stay in top form over the summer. I encourage families to take a look at all Colburn has to offer during the summer months ahead."</p><p> The Community School has added a piano day camp this summer as well. Focusing on activities like choir, duo piano coaching, piano literature and drama, the camp will give intermediate and advanced pianists ages 9&#8211;13 lessons to enhance not only their artistry and technique, but their knowledge and skill set in a broad range of music and performing arts topics. The young pianist does not always have the frequent number of opportunities to collaborate in groups, as with many other art forms. This camp is the perfect opportunity for piano students to come together and learn with their peers.</p><p> Students interested in bringing their singing, dancing, and acting skills to the next level can sign up for one of two musical theater workshops. Musical Theater Camp for ages 9&#8211;13 provides an immersive experience that ends with performance of a song at the end of camp, while high schoolers with previous experience can audition for the High School Musical Theater Workshop with an end goal of helping participants perfect performance excerpts they can use to audition for academic year programs in high school and college. "This is a skill building week for the serous, advanced musical theatre artist," said Denise Scheerer, chair of jazz, tap, and musical theater.</p><p> Another special offering new this summer is the Ballet Choreographic Workshop, which is open to current Colburn students in Ballet Level IV and Advanced Studies Ballet. Outside students can attend by audition. Throughout the school year, students enrolled in the Advanced Studies ballet program work diligently to learn the choreography of their teachers and others in the field, perfecting and focusing on their technique and dance vocabulary. This workshop will place creative control into the hands of the students under the guidance of our exceptional dance faculty. Students will experience the process of choreographing a piece and learn the special role a dancer actively plays in the creation of a new work. The workshop will culminate with a performance of the new works created and performed by the students.</p><p> "Community School camps give students an opportunity to dedicate a period of time to focused study on their chosen art," said Community School Assistant Dean Sara Hiner. "This kind of intensive work can help students make great strides in their artistic development, and summer is a great time for them to focus on it without the pressures of schoolwork weighing on them."</p><p> <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1655" target="_blank">Visit the Community School webpage</a> for more information on summer camps, or to register. <strong>See below for more information on summer dance camps.</strong></p><p><br></p><div><strong>Ballet Choreography</strong></div><div>Under the direction of Kelly Ann Sloan, students will work together to learn the process of choreographing on fellow dancers. </div><div>Daily warm up and technique class led alternatively by Kelly Ann Sloan and Jenifer Ringer</div><div>June 8-12, 2-7pm</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Modern Dance Workshop</strong></div><div>5 days, 5 separate masterclasses in 5 different styles of modern dance</div><div>Daily Technique Class </div><div>Daily Workshop in Choreography and Repertory </div><div>June 15-19, 9:30-5:30pm</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Teen Tap Intensive</strong></div><div>For the highest level tap dancer, features 1 faculty member (Aaron Williams) and one guest instructor (to be confirmed, but anticipated to be one of the Syncopated Ladies)</div><div>June 15-19, 10am-1pm</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Children's Tap Bootcamp</strong></div><div>Taught by Denise Scheerer for beginning to intermediate youth, looking to move up</div><div>June 15-19, 1-3:30pm</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Teen Tap Bootcamp</strong></div><div>Taught by Aaron Williams for teens new to tap, and musical theatre students who want to add to their already dance background)</div><div>June 15-19, 4-6pm</div><div><br></div><div><strong>High School Musical Theatre</strong></div><div>Audition Only</div><div>Audition dates, May 16 and (June 13, possible second audition date)</div><div>Instruction in voice, acting and dance.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/HaoZhouApr2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>Violinist Aim&#233;e Kreston, who teaches in both the Colburn Community School of Performing Arts and the Colburn Music Academy, loves it when she sees her students working hard and having a great time. She's been happy to see them enjoying themselves a great deal lately through a partnership that brings her students together with students from the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Together, students from both institutions share lessons, performances, and social time with other young people passionate about classical music.</p><p> The exchange began after Ms. Kreston attended a pedagogy seminar organized by Rebecca Henry, the Scott Bendann Faculty Chair in Classical Music at the Peabody Institute and faculty in violin and viola. Ms. Kreston and Ms. Henry kept in touch via email after the seminar and, Ms. Kreston said, "the idea just sprouted from there." Despite the challenges bridging the two institutions, Ms. Kreston believes there is tremendous value in the opportunity. "It was eye opening for all of the kids to see a different kind of institution," she said.</p><p> Ten students from the Colburn School visited the Peabody Institute March 12 through March 15, participating in three days of intensive master classes, concerts, and even a trip to Baltimore's revitalized Inner Harbor for a fresh Atlantic seafood dinner. In addition to getting the chance to take lessons with Peabody Institute teachers, Colburn School students joined Peabody students in rehearsals for a combined conductorless string orchestra. "They quickly developed new friendships through the exchange," Ms. Kreston said, "and the exposure to new teachers has been really interesting for them. Some of them are considering applying to the Peabody Institute for their college-level studies."</p><p> Eight Peabody Institute students will come to the Colburn School on April 11 and 12 for the second half of the exchange, structured similarly to the first, with some Colburn School faculty like Martin Beaver providing additional lessons. Christian Tremblay, Chair of the Academy at the Peabody Institute, and Ms. Henry will give master classes during this visit as well. On Sunday, the exchange program will culminate in a concert featuring violin and piano sonatas, string quartets and other ensembles, and a performance by the combined conductorless string orchestra. </p><p> Sunday's performance is free and open to the public. Visit our website for more information.</p>]]></description>
