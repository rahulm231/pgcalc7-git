"The award encourages me to keep striving for excellence in the ballet field so that my students have the best possible foundation for their careers in dance."</p><p> Ms. Ringer was previously a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet and spent two decades on stage before retiring from performance. In 2014, she moved to Los Angeles with her husband, fellow New York City Ballet principal James Fayette, to found the Colburn School's Dance Academy, a pre-professional program for advanced ballet students preparing for careers as professional dancers. The Academy opened last fall with a class of 12 dancers who engage in rigorous study of ballet technique and repertory, along with participation in all forms of dance and exposure to other visual and performing arts.</p><p> "I constantly remind myself each student is unique," Ms. Ringer said of her teaching philosophy. "They have different strengths and weaknesses and different ways of learning. Some students may click with a concept right away, while others may not get it until the last two weeks of the program." These variations means Ms. Ringer focuses on how each student responds best to instruction and to teach each student in the most meaningful way.</p><p> Ms. Ringer has high hopes for her students. "I want to do my best to give them the skills needed to dance professionally in major ballet companies," she said. "This means teaching them to thrive in highly competitive, emotionally and physically demanding environments without losing their sense of self." Her extensive experience in dance has helped her learn how to strike this balance. "I'm going to sound like a mom, but I also just want them to be happy," she added.</p><p> The Dance Academy will welcome three new students to its program this fall, filling spots left by dancers who have joined professional companies or moved to New York to pursue dance full time.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/TZDI_SpringDanceConcertMay2015o.jpg"><br></p><p> The Trudl Zipper Dance Institute and the Colburn Dance Academy will celebrate the end of the academic year with two special dance performances this week.</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606" target="_blank">On May 9</a>, the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute presents the annual Spring Dance Concert featuring accomplished dancers from the Advanced Studies Ballet and Modern Dance programs. The event features new work choreographed by Kelly Ann Sloan, chair of ballet in the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute, to an original composition by the Colburn School's own Musical Coordinator Michael Roberts, an original piece by Tamsin Carlson performed to the music of Arvo P&#228;rt, and with other dynamic dances.</p><p> "The Spring Dance Concert showcases the versatility of the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute's Advanced Studies students, giving them the opportunity to perform classical pieces as well as more contemporary movement," Ms. Sloan said. "I have enjoyed collaborating with the students on a new work to highlight their strengths and give them a feeling of freedom in their ballet movement. Working with composer Michael Roberts and students from the Music Academy has been a valuable experience for the dancers and the choreographer."</p><p> Modern Dance Chair Tamsin Carlson echoed Ms. Sloan's enthusiasm. "The advanced modern students will be performing Movements I &amp; III from Sarah Swensons's <i>Fimmine</i>, a technically challenging work they have spent the year mastering," Ms. Carlson said. " Another thrill will be to see the Merce Cunningham workshop students perform the "MinEvent," created by chance using phrases from Merce's work."</p><p>On May 10, Dance Academy leadership Jenifer Ringer and James Fayette present the inaugural spring performance of the Colburn Dance Academy at the Ram&#243;n C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts Concert Hall on Grand Avenue. </p><p>Dance Academy students will be performing a varied program to include several new pieces to live music.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/JasonSamuelMar2015o.jpg"></p><h4>Photo by Matthew Murphy</h4><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>TapFest, the annual celebration of the art of tap now in its fifth year, will take place on the Colburn School campus on Saturday, April 4. The schedule for the day includes workshops showcasing special guest artists, Colburn School faculty and selected students.</span><br></p><p> "Tap dancers are moving musicians," said Denise Scheerer, chair of jazz, tap, and musical theater in the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute of the Community School of Performing Arts. "Your feet become your instrument."</p><p> To help moving musicians of all ages improve their technique, TapFest brings in top-notch talent from across the country to provide classes designed for different levels of experience. This year's event will feature Emmy Award&#8211;winning choreographer Jason Samuels Smith, percussionist Monti Ellison, and lauded teachers Linda Sohl-Ellison, Aaron Williams, and Steve Zee. Zipper Institute faculty members Blake Colie, Hiroshi Hamanishi, Jerry Kalaf, Angel Pennington, and Melinda Sullivan will also participate in the day along with Ms. Scheerer.</p><p> "Some of these visiting artists don't get to Los Angeles very often, so it's a great opportunity for our students to have them with us," Ms. Scheerer said. Students can take classes in intermediate tap, advanced tap, and percussion over the course of the day. Each class requires a separate registration and fee, though the evening performance starting at 5:30 pm is free and open to the public.</p><p> That capstone performance will feature Mr. Ellison, Ms. Sohl-Ellison, Mr. Samuels-Smith, Mr. Zee, the Colburn Tap Ensemble of elite student dancers, and Colburn Tap Faculty. The Jerry Kalaf Trio will provide musical accompaniment.</p><p> Master classes like those offered at TapFest are important in a student's development. While residential faculty provide key fundamentals and ongoing support and mentorship to students, guest faculty give students an opportunity to become immersed in another dancer's character and talent. "Classes inspire a dancer to think a little differently and have a new experience, an opportunity to grow," Ms. Scheerer said. Guest artists also provide important reiteration of learned lessons. "It validates what we do when visiting teachers confirm what resident teachers say about student learning," she added.</p><p> Visit the <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2425">Tap Fest webpage</a> for more information on the day.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<h5><br><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/DanceAcademy_ChristopherWheeldonFeb2015REVo.jpg">Photo by Angela Sterling</h5><p>One of the world's most respected ballet choreographers will video chat with<a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2618" target="_blank"> Dance Academy</a> students this week as part of a study of his work. Christopher Wheeldon will be the 9th guest artist to visit with the class of pre-professional dancers this year.<br></p><p>Mr. Wheeldon was a member of the New York City Ballet for seven years before retiring from dance to become the company's resident choreographer and first resident artist. His choreography quickly drew acclaim and other eminent companies like the San Francisco Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, and the Royal Ballet, London have commissioned dances from him. </p><p>"James and I both danced alongside Chris during his years performing with the New York City Ballet, and later were featured in his choreographic works for the company," said <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2628" target="_blank">Jenifer Ringer</a>, director of the dance academy, referencing the period she spent dancing with Mr. Wheeldon and James Fayette, who now serves as associate director of the dance academy. "We are excited to have him share with our students not only his artistic vision but also his experiences working with the greatest ballet companies in the world."</p><p>Credited for his role in reinvigorating the full-length ballet form, Mr. Wheeldon has recently premiered works based on Carrol's <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and Shakespeare's <i>The Winter Tale.</i> The latter, which premiered last year at the Royal Ballet, Covent Garden, was called "a ballet to keep" by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. His most recent work, a ballet adaptation of the film <i>An American in Paris</i>, will premiere on Broadway in 2015 after a successful preview in Paris. The film version was itself an original an adaptation of a suite by George Gershwin and featured 16-minute ballet sequence set to this work, so Wheeldon's stage version will put the film version back in touch with its roots in dance and orchestral music.</p><p>Students in dance classes from the Colburn School will view the Royal Ballet's film of <i>The Winter Tale</i> this week in order to witness Mr. Wheeldon's work. After the screening, Dance Academy students will have a chance to ask Mr. Wheeldon questions about his process, his vision, and his career, through online video chat. "We'll definitely want to discuss is his new Broadway show, so there is a lot to talk about," Ms. Ringer added.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/DanceAcademyAuditionsJan2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>The Colburn School's pre-professional program for dancers aged 14&#8211;19 will hold its first round of auditions since launching its inaugural year last fall.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2618&amp;lastid=2701&amp;do=logoffadmin" target="_blank">Dance Academy</a> director <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2632" target="_blank">Jenifer Ringer and co-director James Fayette</a> have scheduled dates in San Francisco and New York to hold auditions for dancers in those regions. A third date for dancers in the Los Angeles region is also included. Auditioning dancers will participate in a full technique class taught by Ms. Ringer. "We'll take them through basic and advanced steps, right up to the very high difficulty level we would expect potential students to have mastered before entering our program," she said. "There's no previously prepared variation as part of the audition, so they only preparation they need is to bring the right shoes," she added.</p><p>Admission to the program is highly competitive and the number of openings for 2015&#8211;2016 will not be known at the time of auditions. Dancers should have at least four years of ballet training; female dancers should be excellent at pointe work. All dancers should have an interest in exploring other forms of dance, music, and visual art in order to become more unique, individualized performers.</p><p>"We are looking for dancers who are not only great technicians, but also great movers. We want them to have musicality, movement quality, and precision," Ms. Ringer said. She went on to describe how a dancer's attitude and outlook on their education are also very important. "We want them to demonstrate an ability to learn and accept correction, and show a willingness to commit to our training."</p><p>The San Francisco auditions will be held February 14 at 4 pm at the San Francisco Ballet. Auditions in Los Angeles will be held March 1 at 2 pm at the Colburn School. New York's auditions will be held March 8 at 2 pm at the School of American Ballet. All auditioning dancers are encouraged to pre-register; full information is available on the <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2630" target="_blank">Colburn School's website</a>. Dancers should arrive a full hour prior to the audition start time to check in and complete pre-registration materials.</p><p>The dance academy's program is currently limited to 12 dancers. Ms. Ringer's philosophy on why is clear and simple. "Having only 12 dancers gives us the ability to get to know each student on an individual basis, which means our classes are closer to private lessons," she said. "We can closely track their progress daily." </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/TapEnsembleImageSm2.jpg"><br></p><p><b></b> "Students love making rhythms with their feet," said Denise Scheerer, chair of tap, jazz, and musical theatre in the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute. "I see them enjoying themselves most when they are really challenged." <b></b></p><p>On January 11, the Winter Tap and Musical Theatre Concert will bring to the Zipper Hall stage students from the Colburn Tap Ensemble, the musical theatre tap class, the apprentice tap class, and the high school musical theatre class. Appearing with the Colburn School students will be two visiting youth tap companies, Everybody Dance, under the direction of Carol and Steve Zee, and the Academy of Performing Arts Tap Ensemble, under the direction of Christy Hernandez. Several students from the new pre-professional Colburn Dance Academy will perform alongside the high school musical theatre class as well. "My students will enjoy friends joining them for this performance," Ms. Scheerer said. "Supporting and welcoming these visiting artists is a great experience for our dancers."</p><p>The concert program includes dances from <i>42nd Street</i>, <i>Oklahoma!</i>, and <i>The Fantasticks</i>. The Colburn Tap Ensemble will premiere two new works during the concert, "Colby" by choreographer Sarah Reich and Ms. Scheerer's own "Jody Grind." </p><p>Ms. Scheerer describes tap as both a visual and musical art form. The movements of the dancers appeal to the eyes while the rhythms of their feet appeal to the ears. Tap dancers must have both a good sense of time and familiarity with percussion study.</p><p>"I hope my students will be proud of their work and have a true sense of accomplishment," she added. "They have worked very hard."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1606&amp;start=01/19/2015&amp;period=month">Visit our website</a> for more information on the Winter Tap and Musical Theatre Concert. </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="//www.colburnschool.edu/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/TZDI_WinterDanceConcertDec2014REV2o.jpg"><br></p><p>Students from ballet and modern dance classes offered by the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute in the Community School of Performing Arts will have an opportunity to show what they've learned at this week's Winter Dance Concert.</p><p>The concert is organized by Ballet Chair Kelly Ann Sloan and Modern Dance Chair Tamsin Carlson and features passionate students of advanced studies ballet, intermediate pointe repertoire, modern III, advanced modern technique, and advanced modern repertory class. "Right before a performance, I often tell students they have nothing to prove, but everything to share," Ms. Sloan said. "I want them to feel comfortable in front of an audience. They've worked hard all semester and that effort will show in their performance."</p><p>Students in these programs make a serious investment of time, energy, and focus in their classes in preparation for the performance. This can include up to two hours of class time before rehearsal time even begins. The physical demands can be quite intense because "for dancers, there is a lot of repetition involved," Ms. Carlson said. "Working on choreography really helps the students understand the necessity of the hard work of each class and how that hard work benefits them." </p><p>The ballet program will include excerpts from <i>Les Sylphides</i> and <i>Don Quixote</i>. Ms. Sloan says the choreography ranges from the romance of <i>Sylphides</i>, featuring variations for solo dancers and intricate patterns for the corps de ballet dancers, to the "dramatic flair" of <i>Quixote.</i> The modern dancers will perform to works by T.J. Troy, Schoenberg, and Glass.</p><p>"I am so excited to show how hard the dancers have worked on the ballet repertoire since September," Ms. Sloan said, noting the two ballets, while based in classical vocabulary, are completely different in style. "Their ability to portray these different styles is a true testament to their versatility as performers."</p><p>Ms. Carlson echoed her appreciation for the students' dedication, adding, "for the parents, many of whom give up three to five evenings a week so their child can pursue this passion, the concert becomes an evening of revelation and celebration. It's another aspect of this job I really love, seeing the pride of the parents and the reflection of that pride in their child."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5462">Visit our website</a> to learn more about the Winter Dance Concert.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>With summer coming to a close, it's almost time for classes to start again for our conservatory, community, dance, and academy students at Colburn. This year also welcomes a brand new program,the Colburn Dance Academy, who has just accepted 12 select students for pre-professional ballet training. Under the artistic vision of Benjamin Millepied and led by former New York City Ballet principal dancers Jenifer Ringer and James Fayette, the dance academy aims to give students excellent training grounded in classical ballet while also instructing them in other dance styles.</p>  <p>Already, news of the new Dance Academy is spreading in professional circles.
