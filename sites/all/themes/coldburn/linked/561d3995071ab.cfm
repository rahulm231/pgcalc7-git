		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/PianoTech475.jpg"><br></p><p> As part of an ongoing partnership between the <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.kawaius.com/" target="_blank">Kawai Piano Company</a> and the Colburn School, 10 seasoned piano technicians seeking enhanced skill training will arrive on campus this week to begin an intensive seminar and training program to prepare them to service Shigeru Kawai pianos, the manufacturer's higher end instrument.</p><p> "Anytime a technician has the opportunity to do advanced technical training directly from the manufacturer, that's a huge benefit to them," said Neema Pazargad, Director of Piano Technology at the Colburn School. It's also a benefit to the manufacturer, whose investment in these technicians means they have a reliable and trusted workforce available to tune and repair instruments in concert halls, educational institutions, and even private homes.</p><p> Participants of Shigeru Kawai's Advanced Technical Seminar are selected by the manufacturer. Past attendees have traveled from across the United States, as well as Europe, Asia, and South America. Technicians attend a group class in the morning, led by Don Mannino of Kawai and a colleague from Kawai's headquarters in Japan, and then each technician is assigned to work with one of the 30 Kawai pianos in the Colburn School's fleet of 165 instruments.</p><p>On the last day of the seminar, instructors and technicians move into Zipper Hall to perform and discuss concert level service on one of two Shigeru Kawai Concert Grands the Colburn School owns. As part of the training, Mr. Mannino plays the piano for the technicians, then modifies the voice of the instrument by changing the height of the lid or moving it even just two feet on the stage to demonstrate how easily our perceptions of tone and sound can change. </p><p>During their time on campus, technicians stay in the Colburn School student residences. Mr. Pazargad wants this to be a meaningful time for the participants. "I hope they all can take their skills to the next level during their time at the Colburn School, and I also hope they get to experience every aspect of our facility, from the incredible access to instruments our students enjoy to the resources we have in the piano technology workshop," he said.</p><p> This is the fourth year of the Kawai Advanced Technical Seminar at the Colburn School.</p><p><br></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/RayUshikuboAug2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>A new series of collaborative concerts at downtown Los Angeles's Grand Performances will put the Colburn School's students and alumni alongside contemporary digital music makers. The back-to-back performances will be held Friday, August 14 and Saturday, August 15 at California Plaza.</p><p>"This is such a unique performance opportunity for our musicians," said Laura Liepins, Director of Career Development at the Colburn School. "It's exciting to see current students and alumni perform alongside musicians from other genres to unite classical and contemporary traditions."</p><p>The Colburn School's alumni performers include flutist Gina Luciani, violist Zach Dellinger, harpist Charissa Barger, and cellist Ben Lash. Current student Ray Ushikubo, recent winner of the Music Academy's Steinway Concerto Competition, will play piano and violin.</p><p>Both the Colburn School and Grand Performances hope the <em>Classical Remix </em>performances will help both sets of musicians to make connections with Los Angeles audiences who may not be familiar with their style of music. The performances will include a traditional performance of a classical piece, which will be sampled, looped, and re-worked by electronic music artists Alfredo Rodriguez, Daedelus, and Mark de Clive-Lowe.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/SummerEncounterJuly2015o_(1).jpg"><br></p><p> Later this week, 60 students from 15 Los Angeles Unified School District partner schools will arrive on the Colburn School campus to begin a two-week odyssey of music, dance, and drama as part of the annual <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1701" target="_blank">Summer Encounter day camp program</a>.</p><p> Participating students, all of whom will begin fifth or sixth grade in the fall, have been nominated by their teachers for demonstrating an interest in the performing arts. Summer Encounter is an important experience for them at this moment as most of the students have limited access or no access to performing arts education during the school day. For some Summer Encounter participants, this will be their first opportunity to play an instrument, to dance, and to perform on stage for friends and family.</p><p style="text-indent:.5in">High school and college students serve as counselors each year, helping students feel more comfortable and to inspire them to keep working. Miranda Landfield, a Community School of Performing Arts alum, returned as a counselor for several years during her summer breaks from the University of California at Berkeley. She's found the experience continues to reward her. "I remember there was a boy named Sam who was always sort of unfocused in dance class. Every day we had to really model for him enthusiasm and energy and try to get him to be engaged," she said. "When we were in dress rehearsal for the final show, Sam came up to me and told me he didn't know the dance routine. There was a lull in rehearsal and I took him aside and taught him the entire routine, from start to finish. At first he wasn't getting it and he became very frustrated. But we worked at it and slowly but surely he eventually had it down. After the show, he ran backstage to give me a huge hug. 'I did it!' he said excitedly. 'I actually did it, and I saw my Mom and my brothers and sisters in the audience,' I will never forget that moment."</p><p> "We want this to be a rich, immersive experience for these students," said Dr. Nathaniel Zeisler, who directs community engagement programs at the Colburn School. "For some of them, this will be a really fun way to spend two weeks of their summer. For others, it will be the start of a lifelong relationship with the performing arts."</p><p> At the conclusion of the summer, 15 Summer Encounter students will have the opportunity to continue their study of music at the Colburn School through a scholarship lasting until they turn 18. The next step for most students will be to enter the Jumpstart Youth Music Program, a concert band ensemble, along with private lessons for their instrument.</p><p> "It's the highlight of our summer when Summer Encounter begins," Dr. Zeisler said. "The campus really comes alive with the joy and excitement of these students."</p><p> <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1701" target="_blank">Summer Encounter</a> kicks off July 20.</p>]]></description>

Current Conservatory student William Hagen will make his professional debut, while current student Simone Porter returns for a second engagement and Conservatory alum Radu Paponiu participates in Aspen's program for emerging conductors.</span><br></p><p> Founded in 1949, the Aspen Music Festival and School is regarded as one of the top classical music festivals in the United States, noted both for its concert programming and its musical training of mostly young-adult music students. The eight-week summer season includes more than 300 classical music events for 70,000 audience members. </p><p> "This is a really special opportunity for any musician, and for our students, it means the opportunity to network and practice with musicians who share their dedication and passion for classical music," said Dr. Adrian Daly, the Colburn School's Provost. "The Aspen Music Festival provides an exceptional environment to interact with world-class musicians, and enhances the training they receive here at the Colburn School."</p><p> Violinist William Hagen made his professional debut at this year's festival, fresh from winning third prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium, the highest showing for an American since 1980. Simone Porter, who received a prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant earlier this year, will return to the festival as a soloist under the baton of conductor David Robertson. Violinist and Conservatory graduate Kevin Lin won this year's Aspen concerto competition and will be performing as soloist with the festival orchestra later this summer.</p><p> "Aspen is one of the oldest and most prestigious classical music festivals in the country," said President and CEO Sel Kardan. "Musicians have launched major careers there. I'm thrilled our students can participate and perform alongside peers and mentors from top conservatories like the Colburn School."</p><p> The <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.aspenmusicfestival.com/" target="_blank">Aspen Music Festival</a> continues through August 23. </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/CIM_Adrian_051515_008_475.jpg"><br></p><p>On May 20, the Colburn School announced Dr. Adrian Daly would assume the position of provost, the school's senior academic administrator, beginning on July 6, 2015. Dr. Daly comes to the Colburn School from the <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.cim.edu/about/bios?id=323" target="_blank">Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM)</a>, and was selected as part of a national search for the newly-created position.</p><p>"I'm honored and thrilled to be joining the Colburn School as provost," said Dr. Daly.

Mr. O'Riley will be joined by Community School of Performing Arts violin student Kevin Miura, who studies with Danielle Belen, for a short performance to open the show.</p><p>Mr. O'Riley has performed as a soloist with virtually all of the major American orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, National Symphony, and San Francisco Symphony. In addition, he has performed recitals throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. Mr. O'Riley received the prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1982.</p><p>The Artspeaks lecture series allowed performing arts luminaries to share forward thinking perspectives on the arts scene in an up-close and personal setting. Mr. O'Riley is the final guest of the 2014&#8211;2015 season, which included National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Chu, celebrated international pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, and arts education leaders Jonathan Herman and Margie Reese.</p><p>Mr. O'Riley strives to introduce new audiences to classical music with an almost missionary zeal by performing piano arrangements of music by Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana alongside traditional classical repertoire. "I think there's good music and bad music, and genre distinctions have only been a matter of concern of late," Mr. O'Riley said. "Mozart and Beethoven played popular music during their time." He has performed recitals featuring these arrangements at such diverse venues as the Istanbul Jazz Festival, Highline Ballroom (NYC), the Knitting Factory (LA), and South by Southwest (Austin, TX). </p><p>Now in his fifteenth year on air as the host of NPR's <i>From the Top</i>, Mr. O'Riley introduces the next generation of classical-music stars to almost a million listeners each week, highlighting performances by musicians between the ages of eight and 18. "Young musicians explore much more widely in their genre-choices, mostly for pleasure, and, as a result of the compelling quality and integrity and beauty of some of those found musical kindred spirits, they may choose to embrace a broader repertoire," he said. Kevin Miura was a guest on the show in March 2015.</p> A prolific recording artist, Mr. O'Riley has recorded the music of Beethoven, Stravinsky, Scriabin, Liszt, Ravel, Gershwin, Debussy, and John Adams. His most recent solo recording featured two discs of Liszt's transcriptions, including songs by Schumann and Schubert, the opera paraphrase on Mozart's <i>Don Giovanni,</i> the Don Juan Fantasy, and Liszt's own transcription of Berlioz's <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>, liberally re-imagined by Mr. O'Riley.<p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2259" target="_blank">Get stories like these delivered to your inbox.

Steinway &amp; Sons pianos are rarely discounted, but through this special arrangement they will be sold at prices well below retail. This exclusive event will only be open to the Colburn School patrons and registered Steinway &amp; Sons customers.</span><br></p><p>Steinway &amp; Sons will schedule appointments on a first-call, first-served basis, though every attempt will be made to include everyone who wishes to attend. Scheduled guests can view pianos on the Colburn School campus from Friday, May 15 through Sunday, May 17.</p><p>Steinway &amp; Sons was founded in 1853 by German immigrant Henry Engelhard Steinway in a Manhattan loft. Over the next thirty years, Henry and his sons, C.F. Theodore, Charles, Henry Jr., William, and Albert, developed the modern piano. They built their pianos one at a time, applying skills that were handed down from master to apprentice, generation after generation.</p><p>Today, each Steinway grand piano takes nearly a year to create. Nothing is hurried. Even the woods employed in the rims, tops, soundboards, and actions cure for months in Steinway &amp; Sons's yard, kilns, and conditioning rooms, until they stabilize at a rigidly specified moisture content.</p><p>To schedule your appointment, contact Steinway &amp; Sons directly by visiting <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.steinway.com/colburnsale" target="_blank">Steinway.com/colburnsale</a> or calling 1-877-783-4692.</p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Jumpstart Recital Will Showcase Young Musicians' Expertise, Enthusiasm]]></title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/JumpstartMay2015o.jpg"></p><p> "They're so impressionable and everything is new to them," said Huei-Yuan Pan of the students in this year's Jumpstart program, who will give their year-end recital on Saturday, May 9, at 7 pm in Zipper Hall. "Any moment could be an 'a-ha' moment."</p><p> The Jumpstart Young Musicians Program serves as an academic year continuation of the Colburn School's Summer Encounter program, in which 60 fifth and sixth grade students from 15 Los Angeles Unified School District partner schools take day-long classes in music, dance, and drama on the Colburn School campus in downtown Los Angeles. Graduates of Summer Encounter receive an invitation to join the Jumpstart program if they want to continue their music studies on campus, and the Colburn School provides them with instruments, small group lessons, and a large ensemble experience for the now 70 participating students.</p><p> Mr. Pan has served as Director of Jumpstart since it began two years ago, when the Colburn School's Drs. Robert Duke and Nathaniel Zeisler approached him with the idea of starting a program for these passionate, energetic, and curious elementary school students. "It was clear we were like-minded, passionate about teaching and learning music," Mr. Pan said. "It was just a matter of building a model that fit the Colburn School and our pre-existing programs."</p><p> His goals for the students are simple: to foster the habits of thought and behavior consistent with mature musicians, right from the beginning. This means teaching the students to play with a beautiful tone, in tune, and with the best musical practices as modeled by the program's teaching artists. "Often times, people will describe novice musicians as being 'fantastic for a group of kids,' but we want them to be fantastic, period," Mr. Pan said.</p><p> The upcoming recital will demonstrate their exceptional skills. Mr. Pan strives to choose music that pushes the students to stretch and grow as musicians while keeping what's asked of them within their grasp. He finds that including students in the music selection process is an important part of their education. "We listen to recordings of the pieces together, and students respond to short written prompts," he explained. "It's amazing how their approach to learning music changes when they have a say in the selection process. You know you've got them hooked when they write, 'I like this piece because it sounds cool!'" First year students will perform works by Sweeney, Daehn, and Smith, while second year students will perform Grundman, Ticheli, and Markowski.</p><p> "Teaching the Jumpstart Young Musicians Program students is easily a highlight for me each week," Mr. Pan said. "Between the staff, faculty, and conservatory students, it takes a village to provide them with this kind of experience. But, I never get tired of watching them light up when they finally 'get it' and seeing them forge new friendships with students from other schools is a special thing - it makes all the blood, sweat, and tears worth it."</p><p><span><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=2500" target="_blank">Please visit this link</a></span><span> to learn more about the Colburn School's community engagement programs.</span></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/stravinsky36225smCr.jpg"><h5>Left to right: Igor Stravinsky, Adolph Bolm and Nana Gollner. | Otto Rothschild Collection/The Music Center Archives.</h5><p><span>The Colburn School recently established a partnership with public media outlet KCET to contribute content to their publication Artbound, a daily compendium of arts and culture journalism focused on Southern California. The first installment of the partnership appeared last Wednesday and shed light on the role of The Firebird in drawing Igor Stravinsky to make a home in Los Angeles for nearly 30 years. <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/the-firebird-los-angeles-stravinsky.html" target="_blank">Visit Artbound to read it</a>.</span></p><p><span>
"The role of Artbound is not just to record, report, and broadcast the cultural stories of our time and our region; our aim is to create mechanisms&#8212;be it partnerships, projects or online tools&#8212;through which audiences can take direct action in the creation of a common narrative," the site's mission declares. As a partner to Artbound, the Colburn School will curate and create a series of long-form articles relating to music, music education, and community engagement as it relates to our work in the Los Angeles area.</span></p><p><span>With over fifty columnists and cultural critics in 11 counties of Southern California, Artbound scans the region, providing seeds of engagement through articles, videos, projects, and partners, who are narrating the cultural stories of our region.</span></p><p><span> 
The online publication has a companion television broadcast of the same name and features televised versions of the reporting on the site. Each week, Artbound selects two articles for a public vote. One article is supported by the magazine's editorial staff, while the other represents the article most liked and shared by Artbound readers. The vote then determines which of the two articles will be transformed into a televised Artbound segment.</span></p><p><span>
Artbound has received many awards for its print and broadcast journalism, including a Los Angeles area Emmy for a story about The Industry's opera Invisible Cities, presented at Union Station via headphones. "By selecting articles that will be turned into short-format documentaries and TV episodes," the editors explain, "Artbound audiences become programmers, curators, and critics, helping us determine what is current and viable in the cultural landscape of our time."</span><br></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/SimonePorter02Mar2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>Colburn Conservatory of Music violinist Simone Porter and students from the Colburn Music Academy and Colburn Community School of Performing Arts will </span><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=6296" target="_blank">perform together in a concert to benefit Center Stage Strings</a><span>, a summer camp for young musicians, on May 1. The program will feature works for violin, cello, and chamber ensembles.</span><br></p><p>Simone, who recently received a 2015 Avery Fisher Career Grant, is an alumna of the camp, which was started by Conservatory of Music alumna Danielle Belen. Ms. Belen has taught violin in the Colburn Music Academy and Community School since 2009.</p><p> Ms. Belen founded the camp to develop the talents of young classical music students in the areas of solo and chamber music performance. Set in Three Rivers, California, at the foot of the sequoias, the natural beauty of the surroundings and the music intertwine to create a unique summer experience. During the camp, students take daily private lessons, participate in master classes, and attend guest artist recitals, which are open to the public. All students perform together on the last day of camp.</p><p> "The students who participate in the camp have an opportunity to focus purely on developing their talents without the distractions of everyday life," Ms. Belen said. "But along with the intensive practice and class schedule, we make sure to create time for socializing and recreation so that these young artists have a chance to get to know one another better."</p><p> The May 1 event will be held in Zipper Hall on the Colburn School campus and will be hosted by KUSC's Brian Lauritzen, who teaches courses in the adult studies program at the Colburn School. Tickets can only be purchased at CenterStageStrings.com, but current Colburn School students can purchase at a special student price of $20.</p>]]></description>

		<title><![CDATA[Rush Hour Concert Highlights "Musical Mavericks," Percussionists]]></title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><br></span><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/DerekTywomiukMar2015o.jpg"></p><p><span>The upcoming </span><i>Gibson Dunn Rush Hour</i><span> concert will take listeners out on a limb with a presentation of contemporary music highlighting the work of percussion students in the Colburn Conservatory of Music.</span><br></p><p>Featuring works written after 1984, the <i>Musical Mavericks</i> Rush Hour concert will feature excerpts from Piazzolla's <i>Tango Suite</i>, Donatoni's <i>Omar: Part II</i>, Steve Reich's <i>Mallet Quartet</i>, and Mark Carlson's <i>Batik for Violin and Piano</i>. The program also features an original composition by Conservatory of Music percussion student Derek Tywoniuk, called <i>This Quiet Night</i>.</p><p>Of the composers included on the program, Derek said, "They're all innovators in their own way. All great composers since Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and the like all questioned the rules of their time, and that's a trait that continues to mark great composers. They force audiences and performers to reevaluate everything they do, to push them further."</p><p>Percussion professor Jack Van Geem was one of the faculty members who helped put the program together. "Richard Beene, Dean of the Conservatory, had been wanting something edgy to add to the mix," he said. "He heard the Reich piece and felt it was perfect. We looked for other pieces like it, pieces that were both challenging and comforting for the audience at the same time."</p><p>Contemporary music represents a departure from the assumptions and standards of much of classical music. While classical composers had their own voices, they tended to compose within a shared spirit of their time. "There are more styles, offshoots of other styles, to even group together 20th century music doesn't really encapsulate all of the possibilities that exist," Derek said. The solo repertoire for percussionists has grown over the last 30 years, Derek added, "and the level of performance by percussionists has skyrocketed during that time." </p><p>Of his own composition, Derek said <i>This Quiet Night</i> was inspired in part by his experience spending late nights alone in the Colburn School's practice rooms. The last half of the piece includes a quotation from Bach, several chords Derek has slowed down to elapse over six minutes, played on a variety of percussion instruments. "I'm fascinated by how we experience time," he said, "how the same interval of time can be gone in an instant or can seem to last forever."</p><p><a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/pagecalpop.cfm?p=1606&amp;verbose=5196">Visit our website</a> for more information on the Rush Hour concert.
