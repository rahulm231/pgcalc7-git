		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/PianoTech475.jpg"><br></p><p> As part of an ongoing partnership between the <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.kawaius.com/" target="_blank">Kawai Piano Company</a> and the Colburn School, 10 seasoned piano technicians seeking enhanced skill training will arrive on campus this week to begin an intensive seminar and training program to prepare them to service Shigeru Kawai pianos, the manufacturer's higher end instrument.</p><p> "Anytime a technician has the opportunity to do advanced technical training directly from the manufacturer, that's a huge benefit to them," said Neema Pazargad, Director of Piano Technology at the Colburn School. It's also a benefit to the manufacturer, whose investment in these technicians means they have a reliable and trusted workforce available to tune and repair instruments in concert halls, educational institutions, and even private homes.</p><p> Participants of Shigeru Kawai's Advanced Technical Seminar are selected by the manufacturer. Past attendees have traveled from across the United States, as well as Europe, Asia, and South America. Technicians attend a group class in the morning, led by Don Mannino of Kawai and a colleague from Kawai's headquarters in Japan, and then each technician is assigned to work with one of the 30 Kawai pianos in the Colburn School's fleet of 165 instruments.</p><p>On the last day of the seminar, instructors and technicians move into Zipper Hall to perform and discuss concert level service on one of two Shigeru Kawai Concert Grands the Colburn School owns. As part of the training, Mr. Mannino plays the piano for the technicians, then modifies the voice of the instrument by changing the height of the lid or moving it even just two feet on the stage to demonstrate how easily our perceptions of tone and sound can change. </p><p>During their time on campus, technicians stay in the Colburn School student residences. Mr. Pazargad wants this to be a meaningful time for the participants. "I hope they all can take their skills to the next level during their time at the Colburn School, and I also hope they get to experience every aspect of our facility, from the incredible access to instruments our students enjoy to the resources we have in the piano technology workshop," he said.</p><p> This is the fourth year of the Kawai Advanced Technical Seminar at the Colburn School.</p><p><br></p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/RayUshikuboAug2015o.jpg"><br></p><p>A new series of collaborative concerts at downtown Los Angeles's Grand Performances will put the Colburn School's students and alumni alongside contemporary digital music makers. The back-to-back performances will be held Friday, August 14 and Saturday, August 15 at California Plaza.</p><p>"This is such a unique performance opportunity for our musicians," said Laura Liepins, Director of Career Development at the Colburn School. "It's exciting to see current students and alumni perform alongside musicians from other genres to unite classical and contemporary traditions."</p><p>The Colburn School's alumni performers include flutist Gina Luciani, violist Zach Dellinger, harpist Charissa Barger, and cellist Ben Lash. Current student Ray Ushikubo, recent winner of the Music Academy's Steinway Concerto Competition, will play piano and violin.</p><p>Both the Colburn School and Grand Performances hope the <em>Classical Remix </em>performances will help both sets of musicians to make connections with Los Angeles audiences who may not be familiar with their style of music. The performances will include a traditional performance of a classical piece, which will be sampled, looped, and re-worked by electronic music artists Alfredo Rodriguez, Daedelus, and Mark de Clive-Lowe.</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><img width="475" src="/uploaded/WebsiteRedesign/News/Photos/SummerEncounterJuly2015o_(1).jpg"><br></p><p> Later this week, 60 students from 15 Los Angeles Unified School District partner schools will arrive on the Colburn School campus to begin a two-week odyssey of music, dance, and drama as part of the annual <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1701" target="_blank">Summer Encounter day camp program</a>.</p><p> Participating students, all of whom will begin fifth or sixth grade in the fall, have been nominated by their teachers for demonstrating an interest in the performing arts. Summer Encounter is an important experience for them at this moment as most of the students have limited access or no access to performing arts education during the school day. For some Summer Encounter participants, this will be their first opportunity to play an instrument, to dance, and to perform on stage for friends and family.</p><p style="text-indent:.5in">High school and college students serve as counselors each year, helping students feel more comfortable and to inspire them to keep working. Miranda Landfield, a Community School of Performing Arts alum, returned as a counselor for several years during her summer breaks from the University of California at Berkeley. She's found the experience continues to reward her. "I remember there was a boy named Sam who was always sort of unfocused in dance class. Every day we had to really model for him enthusiasm and energy and try to get him to be engaged," she said. "When we were in dress rehearsal for the final show, Sam came up to me and told me he didn't know the dance routine. There was a lull in rehearsal and I took him aside and taught him the entire routine, from start to finish. At first he wasn't getting it and he became very frustrated. But we worked at it and slowly but surely he eventually had it down. After the show, he ran backstage to give me a huge hug. 'I did it!' he said excitedly. 'I actually did it, and I saw my Mom and my brothers and sisters in the audience,' I will never forget that moment."</p><p> "We want this to be a rich, immersive experience for these students," said Dr. Nathaniel Zeisler, who directs community engagement programs at the Colburn School. "For some of them, this will be a really fun way to spend two weeks of their summer. For others, it will be the start of a lifelong relationship with the performing arts."</p><p> At the conclusion of the summer, 15 Summer Encounter students will have the opportunity to continue their study of music at the Colburn School through a scholarship lasting until they turn 18. The next step for most students will be to enter the Jumpstart Youth Music Program, a concert band ensemble, along with private lessons for their instrument.</p><p> "It's the highlight of our summer when Summer Encounter begins," Dr. Zeisler said. "The campus really comes alive with the joy and excitement of these students."</p><p> <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=http://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1701" target="_blank">Summer Encounter</a> kicks off July 20.</p>]]></description>

Students will spend the camp engaged in many aspects of piano musicianship in a fun and social atmosphere.</span><br></p><p> Founder Micah Yui said the idea to start the camp was inspired by her students. "I have so many young piano students who go to academic or sports camps, but nothing musical," she said. "I thought this would be a great opportunity for them to really dig into music at a time when they don't have strict demands from school and other activities."</p><p> The camp will include classes and workshops in choir, drama, percussion and rhythm, and duo piano, just to name a few. "I'm hoping the participants see there's more to the piano than just playing the notes," Ms. Yui said. "They need to be complete musicians with a great sense of rhythm, a strong imagination, and a connection with their feelings."</p><p style="text-indent:.5in" rel="text-indent:.5in">Students will also participate in master classes and recitals. Ms. Yui and her co-director Carmina Glicklitch have two field trips planned to enrich the student's experience at camp. A walking tour of the nearby Music Center complex and surrounding areas will end with a picnic, while students will also experience a docent-led tour of the Museum of Contemporary Arts, Los Angeles.</p>The piano is a solitary instrument," Ms. Yui said. "A camp like this brings these young musicians together both artistically and socially so they can develop a strong peer group." While the camp is artistically rigorous and designed to give students a rich and in depth experience, "most importantly, I want them to have a good time," Ms. Yui added.<p></p><p>The inaugural <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.colburnschool.edu/page.cfm?p=1749" target="_blank">Piano Camp</a><span> beings July 20.</span><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description>

"The award encourages me to keep striving for excellence in the ballet field so that my students have the best possible foundation for their careers in dance."</p><p> Ms. Ringer was previously a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet and spent two decades on stage before retiring from performance. In 2014, she moved to Los Angeles with her husband, fellow New York City Ballet principal James Fayette, to found the Colburn School's Dance Academy, a pre-professional program for advanced ballet students preparing for careers as professional dancers. The Academy opened last fall with a class of 12 dancers who engage in rigorous study of ballet technique and repertory, along with participation in all forms of dance and exposure to other visual and performing arts.</p><p> "I constantly remind myself each student is unique," Ms. Ringer said of her teaching philosophy. "They have different strengths and weaknesses and different ways of learning. Some students may click with a concept right away, while others may not get it until the last two weeks of the program." These variations means Ms. Ringer focuses on how each student responds best to instruction and to teach each student in the most meaningful way.</p><p> Ms. Ringer has high hopes for her students. "I want to do my best to give them the skills needed to dance professionally in major ballet companies," she said. "This means teaching them to thrive in highly competitive, emotionally and physically demanding environments without losing their sense of self." Her extensive experience in dance has helped her learn how to strike this balance. "I'm going to sound like a mom, but I also just want them to be happy," she added.</p><p> The Dance Academy will welcome three new students to its program this fall, filling spots left by dancers who have joined professional companies or moved to New York to pursue dance full time.</p>]]></description>

Current Conservatory student William Hagen will make his professional debut, while current student Simone Porter returns for a second engagement and Conservatory alum Radu Paponiu participates in Aspen's program for emerging conductors.</span><br></p><p> Founded in 1949, the Aspen Music Festival and School is regarded as one of the top classical music festivals in the United States, noted both for its concert programming and its musical training of mostly young-adult music students. The eight-week summer season includes more than 300 classical music events for 70,000 audience members. </p><p> "This is a really special opportunity for any musician, and for our students, it means the opportunity to network and practice with musicians who share their dedication and passion for classical music," said Dr. Adrian Daly, the Colburn School's Provost. "The Aspen Music Festival provides an exceptional environment to interact with world-class musicians, and enhances the training they receive here at the Colburn School."</p><p> Violinist William Hagen made his professional debut at this year's festival, fresh from winning third prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium, the highest showing for an American since 1980. Simone Porter, who received a prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant earlier this year, will return to the festival as a soloist under the baton of conductor David Robertson. Violinist and Conservatory graduate Kevin Lin won this year's Aspen concerto competition and will be performing as soloist with the festival orchestra later this summer.</p><p> "Aspen is one of the oldest and most prestigious classical music festivals in the country," said President and CEO Sel Kardan. "Musicians have launched major careers there. I'm thrilled our students can participate and perform alongside peers and mentors from top conservatories like the Colburn School."</p><p> The <a href="http://www.colburnschool.edu/cf_news/forward.cfm?dest=https://www.aspenmusicfestival.com/" target="_blank">Aspen Music Festival</a> continues through August 23. </p>]]></description>
