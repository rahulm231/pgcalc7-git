		<description><![CDATA[It was helpful when you mentioned that someone should mix a little strength training with their cardio, as those muscles shouldn&#039;t be neglected either. This year, I&#039;ve made a goal to improve the health of my heart and body. Thanks for all the great tips on how to keep a healthy body!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a clinical social worker and also have an extended family member with mental illness.  It&#039;s fantastic to learn of this dedicated space at Cooley Dickinson, for people suffering acute MH symptoms.  The general ED is so anti-therapeutic for people experiencing suicidal urges, intense anxiety, or mania, psychosis, and other symptoms.  Thank you so much.  California is the only other place I&#039;m aware of which has been running an &quot;experimental program,&quot; of 24/7 mental health ED&#039;s, but only for Medicaid patients and only one each in 4 of their biggest cities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article on ovarian cancer screening. My sister Lisa died of ovarian cancer at 47 years old after a grueling six-year battle, and my best friend Patty died from it a year later at age 50. Their deaths eventually inspired me to become involved with hospice, and I am now the Volunteer Coordinator at Cooley Dickinson Hospice. As you suggested, I did have genetic testing at CDH (with Dr. Lindsay Rockwell, whom I thought was marvelous!). Lucky for me, I did not have the BRC 1 or 2 genes, so no difficult decision whether to take my ovaries out (so far...). I used to have the CA125 and ultrasound screenings, before the studies came out about their potential for false positives (or negatives). I suppose all we can do is wait and hope for some type of reliable screening device some time in the future - or at the very least, some guidance re: signs to look for (which I know are fairly innocuous or non-existent). Thank you for your work in this field, and for helping to inform women of their options.  Yours sincerely, Carol Devine]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My name is Patricia Klekotka Caler. I entered the 3 yr. program and graduated 1n1969. Kathy Tourville and I spent a few wks vacation at her family&#039;s camp one summer and she took care of my 1st born(which happened to be a placenta previa). Dr. Merzbach saved her life. Mrs. Fish was right on the ball. 
However, if you can connect me with Kathy Tourville(maiden name), I&#039;d really be most grateful I&#039;d really love to hear from her again. I guess this is meant for the alumni association. Many Thanks, Pat]]></description>
