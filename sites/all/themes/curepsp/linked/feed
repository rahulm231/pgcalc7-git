<p>In this article, <strong>Trish Caruana, Vice President &#8211; Patient and Carepartner Advocacy</strong> explains what advocacy is, and the common hurdles people face when considering advocacy.</p>
<p>Care, consciousness and cure are central to the mission of CurePSP, but how we advocate for people with PSP and other prime of life diseases is also important. The lack of understanding in the medical community and the population in general is often a source of pain and frustration to all those affected, but the idea of advocacy, especially when related to rare disease, is also difficult for many people.</p>
<p>Perhaps because advocacy can be a lofty and poorly defined concept &#8211; perhaps the idea seems too time consuming and difficult, or maybe we don’t feel knowledgeable enough to become an advocate. Not all people are comfortable or confident putting their opinions forward or “fighting the good fight.”</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, advocacy is critical to raising awareness about these diseases and advancing policies related to services and benefits for those who are suffering.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is advocacy?</h3>
<p>Advocacy is a way to channel your passion and frustration into action. To become an advocate is to lend your voice for the rights of those who are suffering from the diseases and their loved ones who suffer with them.   There are many ways to get involved, with various levels of commitment. You can work alone from your computer keeping up to date and sharing local, state and national policies that affect the rare disease community, join with others to meet with your political representatives, or any level of activity between the two. We all have talents and ideas and our voices matter.</p>
<p>There is a secondary benefit to becoming an advocate: you will become part of a community with all of those who are suffering with rare diseases and experience the power of creating a united voice. You have an important place at the table and the momentum of the broader rare disease community will inspire you.</p>
<p>Below are some of the primary goals of the Rare Action Network (rarediseases.org):</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a unified state and local network of rare disease advocates who can take action on issues impacting patients with rare diseases</li>
<li>Increase awareness among local healthcare policy and decision makers of the challenges faced by the rare disease community</li>
<li>Address specific legislation related to access and coverage for essential medical therapies</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming an advocacy volunteer with CurePSP, or joining a small committee tasked with defining objectives and an action plan, please contact our office manager, Joanna Teters at <a href="mailto:teters@curepsp.org">teters@curepsp.org</a> or 347-294-2871.</p>

<p>BY STEVE KASKOVICH, Star-Telegram, January 26</p>
<p>More than a year after Fort Worth billionaire Richard Rainwater lost his battle with a degenerative brain disease, his quest to find a cure is making progress.</p>
<p>A group of top doctors and neuroscientists assembled by Rainwater to develop a drug for his condition, called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), has moved four potential treatments into human clinical trials. Scientists believe that any treatment developed for PSP could also be used to fight other degenerative brain diseases including Alzheimer’s and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which afflicts former professional football players.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3596" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3596" src="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/miller-and-rainwater-300x200.jpeg" alt="Dr. Bruce Miller, left, co-director of the Tau Consortium, and Todd Rainwater, right, son of Richard Rainwater and Rainwater Foundation member " width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/miller-and-rainwater-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/miller-and-rainwater-768x512.jpeg 768w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/miller-and-rainwater.jpeg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Bruce Miller, left, co-director of the Tau Consortium, and Todd Rainwater, right, son of Richard Rainwater and Rainwater Foundation member</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We are very much on an accelerated pathway, with a sense of urgency,” said Dr. Bruce Miller, a leading neurologist from the University of California at San Francisco and co-director of the group called the Tau Consortium. “We really believe it’s important we get one good therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Once we get one, all of the diseases will start to fall.”</p>
<div class="teads-ui-components-label">Rainwater, a former investment adviser for Sid Bass who went on to become a billionaire investor, <a  href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article36788415.html" target="_blank">died in September 2015</a> at the age of 71. The <a  href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article7794849.html" target="_blank">Fort Worth native founded the Tau Consortium </a>after he was diagnosed in 2009 with PSP, a rare, incurable neurological disease that first impairs a person’s balance and personality, and eventually impedes their ability to speak and swallow. Rainwater, whose net worth was estimated at $2.7 billion by <em>Forbes</em> magazine in 2014, pumped millions into the research, and when he died some wondered about the future of the consortium. But Rainwater’s family quickly confirmed that it would continue to support the research effort, said Patrick Brannelly, its program director.</div>
<div class="teads-ui-components-label"> </div>
<div>
<p>The consortium’s work has continued with annual funding of about $15 million from the Rainwater Charitable Foundation. To date, the family and its foundation have committed more than $100 million to the effort, Brannelly said, with about 90 percent of the money going directly to research grants. “The family remains 110 percent committed to the mission that Richard gave us,” Brannelly said. “They didn’t waiver for a second.” Todd Rainwater, one of Richard Rainwater’s sons who works with the consortium, said it would have been a shame to shut down the “amazing organization” his father established, which has gained momentum.</p>
<p>“Having gone through what I did with him and seeing him suffer and seeing other patients afflicted with PSP and other diseases like Alzheimer’s, it really inspires me to want to continue to fight,” Rainwater said. “We weren’t able to save Dad, but hopefully can save others from going through such pain and suffering,” he said. “I feel like there’s nothing better to do with my life than to use everything he made to find a cure.”</p>
<p>The consortium, which coordinates the work of about 35 leading doctors and scientists, gathered earlier this month in Irving for a semiannual meeting. The group provides both funding for research and a network so the doctors and scientists can share ideas and make valuable connections. Its goal has been to expedite drug development with its collaborative approach. At semiannual meetings, members provide updates on their work, and other organizations are invited to participate, such as the National Institutes of Health and CurePSP, a group dedicated to research and support for patients and families. The consortium has also helped expand sites for clinical trials, including at UT Southwestern in Dallas.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>In addition to developing new compounds, Brannelly said the group is open to other approaches. Among the four treatments being tested on PSP patients are a blood transfusion therapy and a generic drug that has been used primarily for arthritis. Also, an antibody created by consortium researchers and licensed by Abbvie is moving into Phase Two clinical trials on patients with PSP and early Alzheimer’s disease, the pharmaceutical company said this week. Another half-dozen compounds are in the pipeline and headed toward testing. One potential treatment has recently shown promising results in animals, according to an article published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine<em>. </em>Researchers tested a compound with a synthetic molecule, known as an antisense oligonucleotide, on mice and monkeys and found that it reduced tau in the brain and the Alzheimer-type damage it can cause.</p>
<p>Dr. Tim Miller, a professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis who was a senior author on the article, said similar compounds have been approved for neuromuscular diseases and are being tested in human trials for some neurological diseases. Human clinical trials on PSP patients are expected to begin later this year. “The fact that this kind of compound is in human clinical trials is reason to be optimistic,” he said. Miller, who has been involved with the Tau Consortium for several years, presented results of the study at the recent meeting in Irving. He said the consortium, which provided funding for the oligonucleotide research on animals, has helped spur advances in the field.</p>
<p>The international consortium continues to hold one of its meetings each year in Dallas-Fort Worth, as Richard Rainwater wanted, with a nod to his spirit. Last week’s gathering featured a mechanical bull for participants one evening and a cake in the shape of a longhorn. “Nothing good from the Rainwater family ever surprises me. They have eternal good spirit and energy,” Bruce Miller said. “There is no meeting I go to where I think scientists are treated quite the same way. And the enthusiasm they generate for this research is just huge.”</p>

<p><strong><span class="xn-location first-child">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Jan. 25, 2017</span> /PRNewswire/</strong> &#8212; AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a global biopharmaceutical company, announced the start of two Phase 2 clinical trial programs to evaluate ABBV-8E12, an investigational anti-tau antibody, in patients with early Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In recognition of the lack of treatment options available to patients with PSP, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation to ABBV-8E12. The FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted Orphan Drug Designations to ABBV-8E12 for PSP.<sup class="last-child">1,2</sup></p>
<p>&#8220;We see potential in ABBV-8E12 and tau-focused approaches to progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as early Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and PSP,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person first-child last-child">Eric Karran</span>, vice president, Foundational Neuroscience Center, AbbVie. &#8220;The initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial programs and the FDA&#8217;s Fast Track Designation for PSP signify important steps forward in AbbVie&#8217;s ongoing commitment to investigating innovative scientific approaches with the hope of bringing new treatment options to patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>After consultation with the FDA and EMA, AbbVie is beginning the Phase 2 clinical trial programs following completion of pre-clinical studies and a Phase 1 study in patients with PSP, which supported the further development of ABBV-8E12 in PSP and early Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Positive results from the Phase 1 study in PSP were recently released at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (CTAD) annual meeting in <span class="xn-chron first-child">December 2016</span>.<sup class="last-child">3</sup></p>
<p>The Phase 2 study in early Alzheimer&#8217;s disease will enroll 400 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of ABBV-8E12 to delay disease progression (NCT02880956).<sup class="first-child">4</sup> The Phase 2 study in PSP will evaluate 180 adults and assess the efficacy and safety of ABBV-8E12 to slow disease progression (NCT02985879).<sup class="last-child">5</sup></p>
<p>According to the FDA, Fast Track Designation is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.<sup class="first-child">6</sup> In the U.S., the FDA Orphan Drug Designation is granted to medicines and biologics that are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment medicine.<sup>7</sup> In the EU, Orphan Designation is granted to therapies aimed at the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of life-threatening diseases that affect no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory therapy is available. The medicine must also provide significant benefit to those affected by the condition.<sup class="last-child">8</sup></p>
<p>ABBV-8E12, licensed from C<sub class="first-child">2</sub>N Diagnostics in 2015, is a humanized antibody being studied to target the tau protein, which is thought to stabilize intracellular structures required for maintenance and transport in neurons. Abnormal accumulation of altered tau protein is a hallmark in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, where the development of tau pathology strongly correlates with clinical disease progression.<sup class="last-child">9</sup></p>
<p><b class="first-child last-child">About Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</b></p>
<p>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 34 million people worldwide with the patient population expected to nearly triple by 2050.<sup class="first-child">10</sup> It is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. and there are currently no treatments to prevent or delay disease progression.<sup class="last-child">11</sup></p>
<p><b class="first-child last-child">About Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</b></p>
<p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with an estimated worldwide annual incidence of three to six per 100,000 people; and within the U.S., the disease affects approximately 20,000 individuals.<sup class="first-child">12</sup> The average onset of PSP symptoms typically begins after age 60. The most common features of PSP are loss of balance leading to unexplained falls, blurred vision, problems controlling eye movement and slurred speech. Other nonspecific symptoms of PSP, such as slowed movements or behavioral or cognitive changes, are similar to other brain disorders, particularly Parkinson&#8217;s disease. For this reason, correct diagnosis of PSP is often delayed. The course of PSP is progressive and may predispose individuals to serious complications, such as choking, pneumonia, head injury and fractures caused by falls. Currently, there are no approved treatments for PSP.<sup>12</sup> It is one of more than 20 different neurodegenerative disorders characterized by neurofibrillary degeneration and tau inclusions as a predominant central nervous system lesion.<sup class="last-child">9</sup></p>

<h3>One of our community,</h3>
<p>Richie Morris, whose mother has PSP, is writing and publishing a book for children, to help explain the changes they observe taking place in their beloved family member.</p>
<p>In Richie&#8217;s words; </p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3492 size-medium" src="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-Mum-e1484233214973-300x262.jpg" alt="richie-morris-mum" width="300" height="262" srcset="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-Mum-e1484233214973-300x262.jpg 300w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-Mum-e1484233214973.jpg 657w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />&#8220;Every summer for a couple of weeks my mother, father, brother and I (including our closest friends), vacationed at a small beach in Florida. My mother always looked forward to this trip and loved the time she spent there with her family. This past summer, although Mom had been ill with PSP for several years, we all wanted to go back while she was still with us and so she could see the beach she loved so much one last time.</p>
<p>During this special trip together, I had the opportunity to observe my two-year old niece, Gavin, and her interaction with Mom. It was apparent Gavin longed to be close to my mom, yet because of the unfamiliar symptoms of Mom&#8217;s disease she was unsure and hesitant. When Mom would get upset or cry, Gavin would hide in the spare bedroom and, on several occasions, I noticed her peeping around the corner with a look of uncertainty, fear and confusion. She also began asking her own mom and dad questions such as “What&#8217;s wrong with her?” and “Is she real sick?” This touched me in ways I could never have imagined and I then knew what needed to be done: write a book dedicated to my mother and niece that will help young children navigate the fears and unfamiliar experience of loving someone with difficult physical symptoms broug<img class="wp-image-3493 size-medium alignright" src="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-copy-300x292.jpg" alt="richie-morris-copy" width="300" height="292" srcset="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-copy-300x292.jpg 300w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-copy-768x746.jpg 768w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-copy-1024x995.jpg 1024w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Richie-Morris-copy.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />ht on by disease.</p>
<p>Other young children like my niece no doubt have similar fears, questions and confusion about how to feel and behave when they’re close to someone with a physical and/or mental disorder. The book I envision will not only help young children navigate their difficult emotions and learn about how diseases like PSP can affect their loved ones, it will also help them open up a dialogue with their elders. It will help them understand their fears and uncertainties so they can move beyond them and the symptoms of disease in order to be able to connect with the person they love.&#8221;</p>
<p> Richie Morris needs our help with the publishing fee of $2,500,<strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2041030607/book-childrens-childrens-book-psp-disease-health/description" target="_blank"> see his Kickstarter page here.</a></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>One of the CurePSP community has written this beautiful article on the intricacies of finding love again. </h3>
<p>Article by Joanna McFarland Owusu.<br />
 Posted on Bluntmoms.com, Dec. 2016</p>
<figure id="attachment_3482" style="width: 440px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-3482" src="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bluntmoms.jpg" alt="Portrait of grandmother and her granddaughter preparing for Christmas at home" width="440" height="292" srcset="http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bluntmoms.jpg 810w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bluntmoms-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bluntmoms-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Portrait of grandmother and her granddaughter preparing for Christmas at home</figcaption></figure>
<p>With Christmas almost upon us, I find myself ruminating on a moment last October at the State Fair of Texas, of all places. Every year we make an appearance, indulge in a corn dog and some kind of deep-fried guilty pleasure, and let the kids go on carnival rides until their stomachs turn. I can’t say my husband and I really relish the experience, but we do it for the kids. And this year for the first time, my dad decided to join us, at the prodding of his new wife.</p>
<p>Dad got married a year and a half ago. My mother, who was married to my dad for 42 years, died almost four years ago after a long battle with a progressive neurodegenerative illness called PSP (a cousin to Parkinson’s and ALS). My dad and I were close partners in her care. She got the diagnosis when I was newly pregnant with my first child, so the years that I became a mother are inextricably linked in my memory with the years of her decline. We lived across the alley from my parents, and that chapter of my life is a blur of sorties across the alley to check on her, one child toddling ahead, the other a baby in my arms.</p>
<p>The details of her illness and her slow, inexorable decline don’t bear retelling, but I will say I believe it was a relief to her and to those of us closest to her when the end came. She had been wheelchair-bound, unable to speak and receiving sustenance from a feeding tube. She eked out every last ounce of enjoyment of life for as long as she possibly could.</p>
<p>When my dad announced more than a year later, out of the blue, that he was in a serious relationship and hoped to marry as soon as possible, I didn’t take the news well. I now look back on this as my bratty phase. I acted like a child. Expecting a (surprise) third baby, I blame the pregnancy hormones or the misguided notion that I was losing my dad, in addition to my mom. I pounced on his fiancée’s every shortcoming. There really weren’t that many, but my snark was epic. I grieved all over again, and questioned why this woman, this stranger, would get to be grandmother to my children when my mom was robbed of this. My mom, who loved my children so deeply and fully and continued to find small ways of interacting with them, even when her speech and mobility failed her.</p>
<p>So there we were, at the state fair, and dad’s wife was having as much fun as my children were. We got lucky and turned a corner to find the nightly parade beginning, followed shortly after by a fireworks and light show. Dad’s wife pushed the children to the front of the parade watchers, making sure they got a good look at the Clydesdale horses. She snatched up each of them in turn and danced to the synchronized fireworks show. She lifted my daughter in the air to make sure she had the best view of the lights.</p>
<p>Widowed with stepchildren and nieces and nephews, my dad’s wife never had any babies of her own. And now, at age 70, she’s become grandma to my sons, who only vaguely remember my mother. She IS grandma to my daughter, who is named after my mom and seems to have inherited her feisty temperament. My daughter adores her. This woman, the one I snubbed, has been the greatest help to me since the arrival of our third child, an arrival which turned our already-harried existence upside down.</p>
<p>Watching her with my children that day at the fair, I was overwhelmed by an aching sadness for the grandmothering my mom never got to do. But I also marveled at how life offers new beginnings, for all the premature endings. I felt gratitude for this woman who brought my dad back from the brink of despair. And I saw the beauty in the opportunity life has given this woman to bond so deeply with these children…especially my baby, my mom’s namesake.</p>
<p>This holiday season, whatever higher power you celebrate, if you celebrate one, I think we can all agree that the universe provides us more questions than answers. I will never understand why my mom was stricken with a horrible illness at age 55, or why her life ended at age 61. But I’ve stopped asking why. There is so much goodness and love in this world. This holiday season, and every one after, there will be sadness, but there will also be so much joy.</p>

<p>Many of you know my Dad. I should say many of you are lucky enough to know my Dad. If I had to describe him the first two things that come to mind are smart as hell and strong in both mind and body. My Dad has always been my go to guy for any question (other than cooking of course!). He has always been there to guide me along the way and I truly believe that I am the person I am today because of that guidance.</p>
<p>
 My kids have been lucky to know my Dad before he was robbed. We spent many winters up at my parents Vermont house where my kids will remember building Legos with their Grandpa. Playing all too long games of Monopoly and any other game they conned him into playing. They will remember his infectious laugh and his warped sense of humor! And they will remember him reading, always reading.</p>
<p>
 Sadly they will also remember him falling&#8230;like a 6&#8242; tall tree with no arms and no reflexes&#8230;just falling. They will remember him losing his ability to walk. They will remember him losing his ability to speak clearly and I fear his ability to speak at all soon. They will remember seeing him struggle to eat. And they will remember him no longer being able to read.</p>
<p>
 I do believe that despite all this my kids and I will still remember my dad for who he is, that smart, strong man. Because while this disease is robbing him of his physical abilities his brain is still sharp. He is completely aware that his body and his brain are betraying him and there is not a damned thing he can do about it. And that just sucks.</p>
<p>
 My Dad was robbed. That&#8217;s what this crazy disease does, it robs you of who you are. It literally took doctor after doctor, year after year before he was finally diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). What is that? I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking because who has ever even heard of such a thing. I know that I hadn&#8217;t and apparently neither had a whole bunch of doctors. PSP is a neurodegenerative disease. It is in the Parkinson family and is very often misdiagnosed as Parkinson&#8217;s in the beginning. The unfortunate thing is that PSP does not respond to the medications for Parkinson&#8217;s. In fact there are no medications for PSP right now and there is no cure. There is just time and sadly not a lot of time.</p>
<p>
 My Dad has decided he will donate his brain to research…it’s what he can do to prevent and change the future of this disease. Me all I can do is a whole lot of praying and do what I can to raise awareness and money to help find a cure for this crazy disease. I know I have asked year after year for support for one of my causes but his one is the most important yet. I ask you to help end the suffering for the next family that receives this horrible diagnosis. Please consider donating to Cure PSP below. I truly appreciate your continued support and hope that someday there will be a cure.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Abby Sayre has started a fundraiser on behalf of her grandmother, Mary Kay Withrow.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Mary Kay was diagnosed with Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD). CBD is a neurodegenerative disease that has no known cause, treatment or cure. It affects nerve cells that control walking, balance, mobility, vision, speech and swallowing.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">She required assistance in every area of her life and was no longer able to understand or communicate. But, as she was throughout her life, she was always patient and kind.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">On October 30th, 2016, after living with the disease for more than eight years, Mary Kay passed away.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"> </h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Abby is fundraising this money to donate to CurePSP.</h4>
