<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dear MCU Supporter,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As Marymount California University begins a new academic year, we are reminded of the many years that have led us to this point. Marymount is set to celebrate our 50th anniversary of life-changing work in higher education. Today, Marymount California University provides an awe-inspiring location where real world learning and our long-standing Catholic tradition set the scene for success today and in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The official motto of our university is Tua Luce Dirige, which means “Guide us by Your light.” This light shines on our academic excellence and guides our conviction that each student is sacred. This light led our founders, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, atop this picturesque hill to illumine the future paths of thousands of students over the past five decades. This light will direct us throughout the next fifty years and beyond.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On September 29, 2018, we will celebrate our 50th anniversary on the beautiful Marymount campus. In anticipation of this milestone, we are planning an event deserving of this once-in-a-lifetime occasion. We invite you to share in this celebration by joining us as one of our valued event sponsors. Your dedicated support will not only help to make this event a true success, but it will set MCU on a course to light the way for our next half-century of inspiration.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We offer several opportunities to participate in this epic celebration. Please take a moment to review the attached sponsorship form. Since our event is biennial, we offer you the convenience and option to pay your sponsorship in two separate annual installments. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call Ruben Barajas at (310) 303-7293 or Rbarajas@MarymountCalifornia.edu. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In gratitude,</p>

<p><strong>Torrance, Calif.</strong> – The Marymount California University Men&#8217;s Soccer Team faced the UC Merced Bobcats in the finals of the Cal Pac Conference Tournament on Saturday afternoon at El Camino College. The match ended in a victory for the Mariners, and it marked the 4<sup>th</sup> year in a row that they clinched the title of The Cal Pac Conference Tournament Champions.</p>
<p>The first goal was scored by the Mariners&#8217; <a id="rosterLink0" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/729.php">Enrique Amador</a> (SR/Barcelona, Spain) off of the assist from <a id="rosterLink1" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/986.php">Tekodah Lobsiger</a> (JR/Chesterton, IN) in the 54<sup>th</sup> minute of the match. The Mariners would hold the 1-0 lead for 19 minutes before the Bobcats retaliated with a goal of their own at the 73:52 minute mark, evening the score at 1-1.</p>
<p>Regulation and two overtimes played out, but the score remained tied, leading both teams into penalty kicks to decide who the champions would be.</p>
<p>The Mariners took the first shot, and were successful with <a id="rosterLink2" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/729.php">Enrique Amador</a> scoring on the first penalty kick. The Bobcats&#8217; Artemio Contreras took the first shot for his team and found the back of the net, keeping the score at an even 1-1.

The Bobcats countered yet again with the goal from Luis Martinez tying the game at 2-2.</p>
<p>The third round opportunity for the Mariners was saved by UC Merced&#8217;s keeper, giving them a chance to take the lead. MCU&#8217;s Goalkeeper <a id="rosterLink4" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/1083.php">Ramon Garcia</a> (JR/Paramount, Calif.), however, captured a save as well to keep the score even. Next up for the Mariners was <a id="rosterLink5" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/740.php">Barak Moshe</a> (SO/Jeruselam, Israel) who found the back of the net giving his team the 3-2 lead. MCU&#8217;s <a id="rosterLink6" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/1083.php">Ramon Garcia</a> made another huge save in the fourth round, giving his team the chance to capture the win on the next shot. <a id="rosterLink7" class="rosterProfileLink Male MSO" href="http://www.marinerathletics.com/roster/14/7/743.php">Reece Alexander</a> (SR/Burton-Upon-Trent, England) came up for his chance in the fifth round, and ended the match with the game winning goal.</p>
<p>The win for the Mariners marks  the 4<sup>th</sup> consecutive Cal Pac Conference Championship Title for MCU. Both the Mariners and the Bobcats earned bids to the NAIA National Championship Tournament, which will begin this upcoming weekend.</p>

<h3>How Rankings are Made</h3>
<p class="p1">U.S. News gathers data from and about each school in up to 15 areas related to academic excellence. Each indicator is assigned a weight (expressed as a percentage) based on U.S. News&#8217; judgments about which measures of quality matter most.</p>
<p class="p1">Third, the colleges are ranked based on their overall scores. U.S. News publishes the numerical rank of the top three-fourths of schools in each category; the remaining lowest-ranked schools in each category are placed into a second tier based on their overall score. Schools in the second tier are labeled Rank Not Published and listed alphabetically.</p>
<p class="p1">The data for the 2018 edition of Best Colleges were gathered in spring and summer 2017.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Congratulations</h3>
<p>MCU Congratulates Students, Faculty, Staff and our Board of Directors for helping to contribute to the University&#8217;s continuing success.</p>
