				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have the teachings and ministries at Mile Hi Church made an impact on you? For many of us, Mile Hi Church has changed our lives for the better. Consider playing a part in preserving the programs that the Foundation supports to ensure these teachings live on in perpetuity.</p>
<p>As our annual <a href="https://quantumcreativecommunications.com/dev/project/foundation-february/">Foundation February</a> event kicks off, be sure to stop by Foundation booths before and after Sunday services during the month of February. Foundation Directors and Ambassadors will be on hand to greet you with a cheery smile, a gift, and to answer any questions you might have about the Foundation or membership.</p>
<h3>Dinner With a Minister</h3>
<p>You won&#8217;t want to miss this! Stop by and visit one of the Foundation booths, either in the west Sanctuary lobby or in the Community Center, and you can register for our dinner with a minister drawing!</p>
<p>The Foundation will provide a $200 gift certificate to a local restaurant where you and your plus one can dine with Dr. Michelle or Rev. Joshua. What a great opportunity to spend time with these beautiful souls (and ask any burning questions)!</p>
<h3>Estate Planning Workshop for Non-Traditional Families</h3>
<p>As we all well know, one of the treasured aspects of attending Mile Hi Church is its welcoming embrace of all people. In today&#8217;s world, the typical mom, dad and children family scenarios now share space with blended families, marriages later in life, children of divorced parents, grandparents raising grandchildren, common law marriages, same sex, and other types of families.</p>
<p>On Saturday, February 17, the Foundation is hosting attorney Bridget McCann from 9:30 &#8211; 11:30 AM in the chapel. She will be presenting advice on estate planning for non-traditional families. Don&#8217;t miss this important workshop!</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you during Foundation February</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What You Need to Know About Charitable Gifts</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span>he new tax law took effect on January 1, 2018. Of the numerous changes to the law, two items that will most directly affect charitable gifts include:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">An increase in the standard deduction ($12,000 for singles, $24,000 for married couples filing jointly); and</li>
<li class="p1">The elimination or restriction of numerous itemized deductions (though charitable deductions remain intact).</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Both of the above will increase the number of individuals claiming the standard deduction, potentially reducing the benefit of the charitable deduction. However, depending on your income, property taxes and mortgage, you may find you can still itemize deductions.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if you don’t itemize, here are some strategies to consider that enable you to make lifetime gifts to charity and still receive tax benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Make gifts of appreciated property, property, such as publicly-traded securities. You will still be able to avoid capital gains tax by making a gift of appreciated assets held for at least one year.</li>
<li class="p1">Make gifts using the charitable IRA rollover. If you are over 70Ч, you can make a direct transfer from your traditional IRA or Roth IRA to charity of up to $100,000. Such a transfer is not taxable and counts toward your required minimum distribution. [NOTE: A direct, non-taxable, required minimum distribution (RMD) transfer made to a supporting organization, such as the Foundation, becomes taxable, whereas a RMD transfer is not taxable when made to the Church itself (IRS rule)].</li>
<li class="p1">Make larger charitable gifts. If your total non-charitable deductions are close to equaling the standard deduction, a large charitable gift may increase your total deductions enough that it makes sense for you to itemize. The additional tax savings that itemizing offers may reduce the effective cost of your gift.</li>
<li class="p1">Make a gift from all or a portion of what’s left in your retirement plan. Assets in your IRA, 401(k) or other qualified retirement plan may be subject to income tax when distributed to heirs. Making a charity the beneficiary of a portion or all of your retirement plan will avoid the income tax that might otherwise be due from heirs. This is an extremely tax-efficient way for you to make charitable gifts that costs heirs less than giving other types of assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As with any changes in the law, be sure to contact your accountant or financial planner to understand how the new tax law will affect your individual tax situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span>hanks to some significant growth and retooling in 2017, the Foundation is poised to even more effectively support Mile Hi Church in thriving in perpetuity. Each Nautilus member, donor and director partnered to make this happen.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Endowment Milestone Reached: $1.12 Million</h3>
<p class="p1">In terms of numbers, 2017 was the year the endowment hit a milestone: $1 million in the middle of the year. By year’s end, we were at $1.12 million, close to the $1.2 million we established as our year-end goal. The next milestone is to reach $2 million by the end of 2019. Between our legacy donors (where gifts are deferred until transition), our <em>Giving While Living</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>donors and growth of the existing endowment funds, we should achieve this.</p>
<p class="p1">The endowment performed well as the economy rebounded in 2017. We had a 12.6% annual return after investment company fees. Considering our investment mix, 2017 was an above average year. In addition, we added two charitable annuities to support the endowment, one of which was converted to an outright gift.</p>
<p class="p1">This year, we grew our Nautilus ranks to 240 individuals, welcoming nine new Nautilus members. Sadly, three of our beloved Nautilus members transitioned: former Foundation director Bob Holt, former Foundation treasurer and director Fred Taake, and Nancy Kremer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Membership Growth</h3>
<p class="p1">Visit our Nautilus Wall near the Prayer and Care Center and review the names of those committed individuals and what they stood for. The nautilus shell on a plaque designates Nautilus members who have transitioned.</p>
<p class="p1">To meet our educational goals, we presented to the Practitioner Huddle and congregants via several brunches. Our planned giving ambassador held 21 meetings with 29 interested congregants to discuss their giving goals and which instruments aligned with them.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Planned Giving</h3>
<p class="p1">Optimism for 2018 growth comes in part from some re-tooling. As of February, the Foundation website is being overhauled with more user-friendly features. The website has our new logo and a fresh, modern look. We also have added a detailed page for planned giving that includes downloadable brochures and information on the many potential types of support you might consider, as well as a planned giving calculator tool. This tool helps you explore your unique situation and charitable goals in the privacy of your home. It will calculate the income and tax benefits of your gifts and help explore various opportunities in estate planning.</p>
<p class="p1">It also links you to our planned giving ambassador, Charlie Goldsmith, who can answer any questions you may have and assist you in putting into place any of these giving vehicles.</p>
