				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s portion we encounter what is the Torah’s most unequivocal statement on economic justice.  It reads, and I’ll excerpt the passage, for the sake of brevity:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Efes ki lo yih’yeh b’cha evyon &#8211;</em> There shall be absolutely no poor among you—since Adonai your God will bless you in the land that Adonai your God is giving you as a hereditary portion—if only you heed Adonai your God and take care to keep all this Instruction that I give to you this day….<br />
However, if there is a needy person among you, one of your kinspeople in any of your settlements in the land that Adonai your God is giving you, do not harden your heart and shut your hand against your needy kinsperson. Rather, you must open your hand and lend him enough for whatever he needs.<br />
And beware, lest you hold in your heart the base thought that says “The seventh year, the year of remission, is approaching,” and you end up being mean to your needy kinsman and give him nothing. This person will cry out to God against you, and you will incur guilt. Give to him readily, and have no regrets when you do so, for in return Adonai your God will bless you in all your efforts and in all your undertakings.<br />
Because the poor will never cease from your land, which is why I command you: open your hand to the poor and needy kinsman in your land. (Deuteronomy 15:1–11)</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement is loaded, it begs for a 45 minute sermon.  But I’ve been taught that a good sermon really needs 3 things: #1 a good beginning, #2 a good ending, and #3 the assurance that #1 and #2 are as close together as humanly possible.</p>
<p>This famous statement on economic justice found in this week’s portion, Parashat Re’eh, has puzzled commentators throughout history, particularly because of inherent contradiction in the text &#8211; the declarative statement that there must not be poor people in the Land &#8212; that’s a commandment, meaning it’s on YOU to ensure that there are no needy&#8211; and then the recognition that there may be needy so this how you should act.  Now, we might reconcile the two in a variety of ways.  But the text goes even further, “<em>ki lo yechdal evyon mikerev haaretz</em>— the poor will never cease from the land!”</p>
<p>So to rephrase, three commandments:<br />
1) There must not be poverty in your midst.<br />
2) If there is poverty, fix it &#8211; you’re accountable.<br />
3) There will always be poverty.</p>
<p>What kind of Covenant is this?  A commandment that we’re given, followed by the Divine proclamation that we <em>have to</em> fulfill it&#8211; and will <em>never</em> fulfill it.  Is this some kind of trap?</p>
<p>Perhaps.  But perhaps it’s a reflection on the tension between Divine law and human nature, between the world-as-it-should-be and the-world-as-it-is.  God dictates the world-as-it-should-be, but the-world-as-it-is… is dictated by human behavior.  <em>The human being</em>.</p>
<p><em>So let’s consider this: What does this text suggest about human nature</em>?</p>
<p>When we read political part of the Bible, such as this, we can assume: if there’s a law, there’s a reason for it, a necessity for it. As James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, “If men were angels, no government would be necessary.”<br />
This was not a novel idea, he was likely drawing on the words of John Calvin, who said two centuries prior:</p>
<p><em>If we were like angels, blameless and freely able to exercise perfect self-control, we would not need rules or regulations. Why, then, do we have so many laws and statutes? Because of man’s wickedness, for he is constantly overflowing with evil; this is why a remedy is required.</em></p>
<p>This Calvinist polemic, like it or not, resonates among our biblical stories.  From the very beginning, human beings mess up: Adam lies, Cain kills, Noah turns his back on humanity.  As a colleague of mine often says, “Reading these stories, you would never want your children to be like our biblical ancestors.” Abraham shows faith by offering to slaughter his son. Isaac spends the rest of his life traumatized and mostly silent. His wife Rebecca deceives him, conspiring with their son Jacob who cheats and steals the birthright and blessings from his brother Esau (who’s really hairy by the way).  Let’s not even get started on Jacob’s kids (wouldn’t want to ruin act II of Lloyd Weber’s musical).</p>
<p>Throughout the Exodus, we see similarly dreary views on human nature.  Moses’ reluctance, Aaron’ and the Israelite’s betrayal of God at Sinai.  Suffice it to say, if a text can “think,” as literary scholars often urge readers to consider, then this text of ours thinks very little of the human being.</p>
<p>And the Rabbis picked up on this in the Rabbinic Period.  They knew Torah like the back of their hands.</p>
<p>In the Midrash, Genesis Rabbah (8:5), Rabbi. Simon taught that when God came to create <em>adam, </em>the human, the angels argued with each other, vociferously.  They were divided into 2 camps, with one arguing, “the human being must not be created!” and the other side saying, “the human being must be created!” While they were arguing, God created the human being and said then said to the angels, “what are you arguing about— it’s already done!”</p>
<p>The argument, of course, is whether human beings are good or bad &#8211; whether or not Calvin gets it right.  But for the Rabbis who told this story, the question was different.  And for us as well, the question is:<br />
<em>How do we deal with the duality of our nature. </em>And I mean this not philosophically, but in the most practical, realistic ways.<em> </em>How do we reconcile our potential to love each other &#8211; and show our love through actions, generosity, forgiveness, kindness, empathy and laughter…. with our propensity to bend toward sin, selfishness, cruelty, humiliation, lies, even murder?  What does it mean to be human?  This duality makes its way into our everyday language, when we say:<br />
<em>“I’m only human!” vs. </em><em><br />
</em><em>“How can I be more human” </em><em><br />
</em><br />
Well, which is it?</p>
<p>That is the question that we begin focusing on tomorrow night.  Tomorrow begins the month of Elul, the final month before Rosh HaShanah, our Jewish New Year.  The hard work of the New Year in Judaism is called “<em>teshuvah</em>,” often translated as “repentance,” but literally it means, “turning or returning.”</p>
<p>Turning from “<em>I’m only human</em>” to “<em>how can I be more humane</em>.”  And this hard work that goes into the New Year does not begin on Rosh HaShanah— it begins now.</p>
<p>The month of Elul is known as a period of deep introspection, a period of apology, forgiveness, goal setting, hoping, and yearning.  This is hard work, and it requires vulnerability.  There is no other way to begin without the willingness to look in the mirror honestly.</p>
<p>To notice when our hands are closed so we can open them;</p>
<p>to see when our eyes are resentful, so we can fill them with compassion;</p>
<p>to hear when our hearts harbor thoughts that will make our deeds neglectful towards our brothers and sisters, near and far.</p>
<p>An 18th century Hasidic master Reb Simcha Bunim famously taught that we should keep two slips of paper at all times &#8212; one in each pocket.  One should say, &#8220;<em>Bishvili nivra ha&#8217;olam&#8211; the world was create for my sake.&#8221;  </em>The other slip should read, &#8220;<em>Anochi afar va&#8217;efer&#8211; I am dust and ashes.” </em> The most important part is knowing when to pull out which slip of paper.</p>
<p>Living in the month of Elul involves a vacillation between both slips of paper.  And it’s not easy.  How do we lower ourselves to the ground?  How do we lift ourselves up?  What does it mean for each of us, who is only “only human,” to be &#8220;more human&#8221;?</p>
<p>Welcome to the month of Elul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading Michelle Alexander&#8217;s <em>The New Jim Crow</em>, an extraordinary work on the travesty of mass incarceration today in the US, particularly of African Americans. I haven&#8217;t yet recovered from what Alexander achieved in this work, essentially a telling of the facts, the reality, the truth about a state of injustice that I simply can&#8217;t wrap my head around completely.</p>
<p>Incomprehensible &#8211; to think that at this moment the US has a greater percentage of its citizens incarcerated than any other country in the world&#8230;. That incarceration of the African American community is greater now in this democracy of ours than in South Africa at the worst moment of the Apartheid&#8230;.</p>
<p>This week I began another book &#8211; <em>Deuteronomy</em>. The Greeks called it Deuteronomy (deuteros nomos, &#8220;second&#8221; and &#8220;law&#8221;) because essentially it was a re-telling, a revision, in fact, of a collection of stories from Exodus through Numbers that explained who we were and what we needed to do about it. The imperative to retell, to revise the popular narrative, is an imbedded aspect of our tradition. It&#8217;s in our DNA. Most scholars believe the author, or more likely, authors, of most of Deuteronomy knew the other 4 books. If that&#8217;s the case, then these anonymous writers and storytellers had a point to make&#8211; they saw that the dominant narrative, the myths of origin, and their subsequent obligations needed a new reality check. So little is known about the ancient mysterious authors- our ancestors- who began this age-old process of creating what we now call Scripture, sacred literature, which we believe (or, if you will, we hang onto hope) that it can lead us into relationship with the Divine.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that only ancient texts lead us into relationship with God. Just as the Prophets isn&#8217;t the only canon of literature that can wake up a people to their obligations to humanity. There indeed seems to be, at least in my conscience, a stitching between the end of <em>The New Jim Crow</em> and the beginning of <em>Deuteronomy</em>. Race relations today need a &#8220;deuteronomy&#8221; of sorts because slavery is not over, it&#8217;s just hidden. No, worse, we are hiding it.</p>
<p>Mass incarceration is the new slavery. And as a Jew, an heir to a myth of origin that says, &#8220;because you were slaves in Egypt,&#8221; no less than 36 times in the Torah, my social conscience is aching. I hear in my heart the voices of the Prophets crying out from generations past.</p>
<p>Following the reading of <em>Deuteronomy</em> tomorrow morning, in our <em>haftarah</em> the Prophet Isaiah will have the last word (excerpted):</p>
<p><em>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Eternal has spoken: Children I have reared, and brought up, and they have rebelled against Me&#8230;.O what a sinful nation&#8230;. Learn to do well; pursue justice, relieve the oppressed&#8230;.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My trip with AIPAC ended two days ago. But, I am still here in Israel. I chose to spend time with my brother and the rest of his family in Jerusalem. I wanted to settle into a different kind of lifestyle of Israeli living than the one I had been on from 6am to 9pm every day last week. I have not left the trip behind, however. What I learned and experienced rests comfortably and uncomfortably in my mind.</p>
<p>Israel deals with the challenges and triumphs of security, economic and social equality, and religiosity. This is not a complete list but it has helped me to place some of the issues in perspective. The reason I am grateful and honored to have been part of this journey is that we were exposed to both the challenges and the triumphs without direction from our group leaders on how to interpret. Each of our opinions received great respect even in disagreement.</p>
<p>Every Israeli faces the existential challenge around security. This morning, I was about to go for a long run when the siren went off. (Thank goodness, I had procrastinated and had not left!) I was with Susan, my sister in law, at their home. The dog started to bark in a panic. We all stood in a corner of the room where they had stood numerous times last year. I could feel the disequilibrium of the moment and Susan’s return to what she might have felt like last year. It turned out to be an unexpected drill but for that moment I entered that place of fear with her. Last year, my nephew was in Gaza. This morning, he, newly married, and I had a breakfast of crepes at a new restaurant down the street.</p>
<p>On our trip, we witnessed the close borders of Lebanon and Syria. We stood atop a very tall building in Tel Aviv staring at the stark reality of the dense population, an easy target for destruction. In the building next door, we learned about the vast and advanced defense system Israel has developed to protect herself from short, medium, and long range missiles. I knew about the Iron Dome and became familiar with other systems with names like David’s Sling and Arrow One and Three. I would not dare to underestimate the crucial relationship regarding military matters with the United States. That connection and Israel’s constant work to defend herself strive to meet existential challenges.</p>
<p>In the economic and social equality realms, the underbelly of Israel’s society shows clearly. The disadvantages of Israeli Arabs, the mistreatment of Ethiopians, the lack of acceptance for LGBT, and the great frustrations for many Palestinians at border crossings and in the West Bank are some of Israel’s challenges we learned about. I know there are more. The list is long. In contrast, our spirits were buoyed by the work of Israeli citizens who embody justice and morality in how they are working to improve the economic and social disparities. We met Estelle Bar Ilan whose Ethiopian family arrived in 1984 on Operation Moses. One of 9 children, she is now married with a child of her own. She described the Ethiopian situation as “in no one’s land, not like us, not like them, not being seen as Jewish. It is very hard.” And yet, she was helped by an NGO called Olim Beyachad (Immigrants Together!) formed by other Ethiopian immigrants to help this community get degrees and jobs. People like Amir Ohana and Daniel Jonas are paving smoother paths for the LGBT communities. Amir is an active member of Likud and is working within this conservative party to end discrimination through legislation. He and his husband are also expecting twins from a surrogate in Portland, Oregon next month. Daniel told us his story about growing up in a religious community and suffering with depression as a gay man. He helped to create Hevruta, an organization to support orthodox gay men. They work with Bat Kol that helps orthodox lesbians. We encountered other individuals and organizations that are engaged in inspiring work to repair the difficult breaches of economic and social disparities. Many of these problems seem intractable but the spirit to chip away toward improvement is just as obstinate.</p>
<p>Before I arrived in Jerusalem, one of the Knesset members, David Azoulay, Minister of Religious Services, repulsed the progressive communities in the States by his comments that Reform Jews aren’t really Jews. The reaction was swift and angry toward him. I left the states with demands for his resignation screaming throughout Facebook, in public statements, and in journals and newsletters. Though reprimanded, he is still in office. Netanyahu’s government coalition only has 61 out of 120 members. If they lose him, they lose the majority. It is an unfortunate reason to allow him to stay but then again I learned about another Knesset member whose behavior in other ways is even more egregious and he remains as well. Religious issues plague Israeli society. 25% of engaged couples choose to leave the country rather than have the Chief rabbinate have anything to do with their wedding, let alone their marriage. Marriage, however, is the tip of the iceberg. From our point of view in the diaspora, we see these concerns as paramount. Issues around security and social and economic inequality occupy much more of the Israeli psyche. Even so, it has been heartening to read more articles about small pockets of improvement. The Jerusalem campus of the Hebrew Union College (my rabbinic alma mater) will receive government financial support. An Orthodox rabbi will sit with a Conservative and Reform rabbi on a public panel discussion and examine specific issues together. These are small gigantic steps that matter greatly.</p>
<p>Where do the Palestinians fit in to this matrix? They are an intricate part of each issue. Resolving security, economic and social injustices, and religious differences affect and impact how Israel seeks to live in some kind of purposeful resolution with the Palestinians. There are other additions to the matrix as well. Agriculture and sustainability, the change of status from a developing country to a developed country and its impact on capital (financial) infusion are also part of the complexity of this country. It is a 3D intricate system. Israel’s core needs to be strong. It can’t just have outside pressures to unite it.</p>
<p>I believe in Israel as a country and a people to discover and to renew its own strength and ability. While at times, it feels enervating, this country, with all of its challenges and triumphs, remains energizing to me and I hope to you, too.</p>

<p>Part of me wishes I could say I have figured it all out.  We have met with members of Knesset, Israeli academics, representatives from the Arab community, and Palestinian leaders and business people. We have traveled intellectually through difficult conversations on rocky terrain trying to understand this complex reality called Israel. And that is just two days worth of experiences.</p>
<p>Israel is a paradox, a combination of contradictory ideas that form this amazing country. There is a constant tension about living in a world as it is but aspiring for how it should be.  It is fair to want to see justice, equality, security, and compassion manifest in daily life, expressed in civic society, enacted in government agencies and yet it is not an easy task nor does it always happen.</p>
<p>We traveled to the Rachel Crossing between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. We arrived early in the morning as many Palestinians entered into Israel to work.   Dr. Yoaz Hendel, the founder of Blue and White Human Rights, met us there and took us through in the same way the Palestinians enter the country from the West Bank.  It had the same feel as standing in line at passport control or TSA screening in the states. However, most of us don’t have to do this every day.  We also met Israeli soldiers, who were in their early 20’s who told us they work very hard with the Palestinian authorities to create a smooth crossing from the West Bank into Israel.  I was surprised to learn that they let women and people going in for health reasons to pass through more quickly through a special dedicated line.   It was very clear how important it is for the soldiers and the group Dr. Hendel formed to ensure as much humanity as possible.  I believe their good will efforts despite the difficulty to manage the thousands of people who cross each day.  I also felt their frustration of being the number ONE destination of human rights groups who prefer to come to Israel because it is safer than other places in the world and who are determined to find some abuse to document.  Are there difficulties? For sure.  Are they intentional? Not clear.  Just last week, one of the women who were allowed to pass through stabbed a soldier in the neck.  It was a grave but not fatal wound.  Everyone is concerned for his or her own safety and well being wherever they live and wherever they are going.  Good will is certainly present but so are restrictions.  They have to endure these contradictions.</p>
<p>Attorney Mohammad Darawshe, an Israeli citizen, from the village of Iksal, whose children are the 28<sup>th</sup>! generation living in this land.  His work centers on Arab/Israel relations.  He has served members of the Arab party in the Knesset and knows his way around the Israeli government.  And yet, even as a full citizen of the state, his opportunities are different that his Jewish Israeli neighbors.  He works for social, economic, and political equality and still watches as the schools his daughters attend do not have the same opportunities.  He smiles with pride about the number of Arab doctors, nurses, and dentists.  His daughter will finally attend medical school this year.  We applaud.  Israeli Arabs populate the healthcare field in higher percentages.  We witness his pain of wanting equal access and devoting his life to working toward that end.  He tells us,  “Politics is the art of what is possible, what you can do, not what you can believe.”  He lives in a paradox, too.</p>
<p>We traveled into the middle of the West Bank to a planned community called Rawabe.  The land used to be desert.  Now it is filled with neighborhoods built around playgrounds, movie theatres, fields, and places for business.  No one has moved in yet.  In August, the first residents who have bought these beautiful apartments will move in.  There is great excitement in the air as our bus passes through this self-sufficient inspirational community.  We are awed by this mammoth effort of self-empowerment for the Palestinian people.  It is a testimony to a desire to create a stable environment and home in which to live and thrive.  It hasn’t been easy to build.  There were difficult negotiations with Israel to get water into the city.  It took years to resolve.  Everyone knows the story. The Palestinian Authority has not kept its promises to provide assistance.  Despite the difficulties, their excitement was contagious and we felt the energy this endeavor was bringing to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Lastly, the reaction to the US agreement with Iran remains ever present.  As people here worry over the potential for Iran to finance more terrorism with the billions of dollars it will receive as the sanctions are lifted and whether or not any agreement can truly deter nuclear proliferation, they vacillate between, as Ari Shavit has written,  “prophets of doom” and “dynamic diplomatic players.”  There is much more yet to be said, written, and resolved.  The feeling of vulnerability and the continued existential threats Israel has faced is still everywhere even though the coffee shops, restaurants, streets, and shops are filled with Israel’s citizens living their daily lives.</p>
<p>Israel is a beautiful paradox with much strength and perseverance demonstrated by the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the Jews.</p>

<p>We landed to the news that the US had reached an agreement with Iran over the extensive negotiations regarding sanctions and its nuclear program. We walked off the plane checking our phones quoting headlines and reactions as we headed toward the passport check area. While some world leaders rejoiced at the long sought resolution, others in Israel were less sanguine. We heard at dinner that Israel’s Security Council had been meeting all day. Two leaders of our group had arrived in Israel last year to the beginning of the war in Gaza. They witnessed with their own eyes bombs over their heads being blown up by the protective patriot missile system. To arrive with this news made all of us wary and worried.</p>
<p>The heaviness of the moment though lifted as we walked into the warm sun and the landscape of desert, blossoming trees, and lots of building projects.</p>
<p>It always strikes me as curious whenever I travel to Israel. Many news reports paint a bleak picture of the situation in Israel and yet growth, new projects, and people moving about living their lives give another impression. I was surprised by what I learned at dinner.</p>
<p>As we sat at a restaurant facing the old city with the setting sun casting an iridescent golden glow on the ancient walls, we heard a Senior Correspondent of the Jerusalem Post address the question of what is on the minds of Israelis. There is no one answer, of course. To provide one would be to ignore the diversity of the country. Yet, he did make some interesting observations. To understand Israel is to recognize the personal insecurity people feel. It doesn’t matter what community or association one has. In every corner, anxiety over safety touches everyone. Most have one degree of separation from tragedy. There may be tension with Washington DC, but it is no match for the risks born by those living in this region.</p>
<p>I asked him whether he knew if more people were leaving Israel as a result. He said the numbers show there are no more than usual. He also spoke about social issues such as the wide gap between the poor and the wealthy, social welfare and education challenges. He mentioned more than once the difficulty regarding affordable housing especially as he watches his grown children struggle to find a place to live.</p>
<p>As much as all of this sounds pessimistic, he was not. It is not the Israeli way. Our speaker pointed out that the Israeli people have a tendency toward hyperbole. The root of the problems remains but perspective is important.</p>
<p>Israel is a tenacious country. It is not an easy path to move forward but it never was. Our ancestors complained their way through the wilderness. Some did not make it to the land. Others fought with their lives while others thrived. It still occurs today. They still piece together their lives and continue to build and to plan for a future. Hope is eternal. I continue to find new pieces to the puzzle that make up Israel and I will continue to share them with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m traveling to Israel today because AIPAC honored me with an invitation to join 19 other rabbis from Reform and Conservative congregations to explore Israel from multiple vantage points.  We will be meeting with Knesset members, activists on the West Bank, Arab and Palestinian leaders, religious and secular Jews, Muslims, and Christians.  They all reflect the rich diversity of Israeli society.  I&#8217;m eager for the exposure to opinions and ideas I may or may not agree with.  I&#8217;m grateful to AIPAC for its willingness to present truths and facts it may or may not agree with.  I begin this journey with eyes wide open but also with a heart full of love and commitment for Israel.</p>
<p>Our own country has ideals it works to promote: Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to name a few, are manifest in magnificent ways.  It makes me proud to be an American.  We know, however, if we scratch the surface, dirty truths lie underneath. Inequality, racism, sexism, poverty, hunger, and a scorched earth from overuse and drought are just a few of our challenges.  Yet, we also know that as citizens, we are stewards of our wellbeing to bring justice and fairness.  To condemn, to judge myopically, or to dismiss without asking questions and seeking solutions would only bring further deterioration and pull our country apart.  The obligation to work for our welfare rests on all of us.</p>
<p>Israel is no different in this respect.  Founded on ideals and values, she, too, must strive to overcome significant difficulties. Ultra-religious dominance, societal prejudices, inequality, and injustices abound. It is not just issues surrounding the West Bank and Gaza; reaching any accord from the prevailing discord is an entangled conundrum.  Yet, innovative attitudes and tenacity permeate its existence as well.  Unlike us in the United States, the neighborhood also presents life-threatening trials.  Israel&#8217;s strength, vitality, and health matter not only to the Jewish people and all of her citizens but also strategically to the world order.</p>
<p>It is an auspicious time to be there.  US negotiations with Iran to control its nuclear potential are still in play and hover close to reaching a deal.  Comments by the Minister of Religious Services, David Azoulay, disrespecting Reform Judaism by saying he doesn&#8217;t consider us Jews infuriates us and undermines a core tenet of Israel as a place for all Jews.  In contrast, weeks ago in Tel Aviv, hundreds of thousands gathered for a Pride celebration and the Israel military changed a policy that gay or lesbian parents do not both have to serve in the reserves at the same time, a small but significant act of recognition of equal marriage.  We are going to meet the people who are treating Syrians injured by war.  And still there is more.  Israel is complicated by its complexity.  It certainly isn&#8217;t a melting pot and may be more like a simmering cauldron but I feel inextricably linked to its past, present, and future.</p>
<p>I travel toward the land with many questions but not with apprehension.  I feel charged to challenge what I know even as I seek to learn more from perspectives not my own.  I look forward to sharing with you what I discover, what unnerves and surprises me and to deepen understanding as a bridge from one home to another.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unjust and disturbingly recent murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner have sent much of America into turmoil, as people grapple for an opportunity to change the rampant injustices that are still present in our society. On the night of Tuesday, November 25<sup>th</sup> I attended the “Indict America” rally hosted by the non-profit group Black Lives Matter, with fellow RYFTI members (Charlotte Borden, Talia Putnoi and Ada Levine).  It was incredible to witness so many different people coming together around an issue that not only disproportionately targets young, black men in America but which plagues the entire country as every person is affected by the many intersections of all forms of oppression. I stood in Dudley Square for a moment of silence, passed vigil candles among the strangers surrounding me, sang songs of respect and hope, chanted “No Justice! No Peace! No Racist Police!,” and finally marched through the streets of Boston. The night was incredibly moving and inspiring, because I knew there were thousands of people beside me, all of whom have entered the same fight to end racial oppression.</p>
<p>After being a part of the collective voice of countless citizens of Massachusetts, I had the opportunity to see how action is being taking at the state level to address the problems of police brutality and racial profiling in Massachusetts. During RYFTI’s fall semester at Temple Israel, I took a social justice action course called “TIKKUN” at Monday Night School. TIKKUN culminated with a trip to the State House, where each teen participating in the course met with their local state senators and representatives to lobby on behalf of issues we are passionate about. This MNS elective showed me that the legislation in Massachusetts is important to become involved in, because I have the voice of a constituent who can influence the issues my local leaders choose to address. Through this lobbying experience, I was invited back to the State House to attend a briefing, as an honorary member of the staff of my state senator, Sonia Chang-Diaz, on Wednesday, December 17<sup>th</sup>. At the briefing, Boston leadership of the NAACP and ALCU, and State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz addressed three new bill proposals that may be introduced in the upcoming legislation session in light of the recent events in our nation. These bills discuss the availability of data regarding racial profiling, potential body cameras for police and continuing to promote a police force that should reflect the racial composition of our city. It was so interesting to witness politicians, non-profit organizations and interested individuals from all across the political spectrum taking the time to ask each other questions and learn from one another. The fact that so many influential people worked hard to attend this meeting truly demonstrates how important this issue is to our society and the great lengths and efforts people will contribute to affect change.</p>
<p>Experiencing the responses to injustice in America both on the ground and in the State House, it is clear that the actions taken by those today may finally stand a chance at significantly affecting the future of our country and creating beneficial change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past summer, I led a group of nine high school freshman girls to live in Boston&#8217;s Chinatown, in a church basement, on minimum wage, for one week. We called this program &#8220;Urban Immersion.&#8221; Coming from a privileged school, I always felt like my school, Newton Country Day, wasn’t the real world. I was aware however, of all the injustices that happened around me in the city of Boston. I was sick of hearing people say “you shouldn’t throw that away, there are starving children in Africa.” There are starving people right next door to us, too. This is why I chose to help form what became Urban Immersion 2014.</p>
<p>The program lasted Sunday to Thursday. The structure of the program was that the first day we went shopping for food on a minimum wage budget. I split the girls into groups and they were each tasked with making dinner for one of the nights we were there. The girls found it very difficult to buy what they liked to eat &#8211; a healthy and nutritious meal &#8211; for less that twenty-one dollars. After shopping we drove the girls into Chinatown to introduce them to their home for the week. They described it as “urban camping” sleeping on the floor, sleeping bags, and, of course, lack of air conditioning.</p>
<p>Each day we went to different community service sites: soup kitchens like Rosie’s place and Women’s Lunch Place, childcare facilities for families in poverty like the Ellis Memorial School, and elder care facilities, like Hearth and Boston Health Care for the Homeless. In our social justice-dirven mission, advocacy was as important as service, so at night we had speakers from the Massachusetts Housing and Society Alliance, some of whom had experienced poverty as youth or as adults. The girls took away a variety of messages from those speakers, but specifically, that homelessness can affect anyone and that it is happening everyday all around us.</p>
<p>The last day of Urban Immersion we went to the Massachusetts State House to share with and advocate to our representatives about the things we’d learned that week. We shared with them the outline of the program, the stories of the people we’d talked to, and the ways we urged them to help. We explained to them the importance of subsidized housing and how the government is paying a significantly larger amount of money on emergency shelters than if they would help place families in homes. We then heard about what these representatives were doing to help end hunger and homelessness in the Boston area. To be able to connect what we’d learned that week to actually making a difference in the State House was a moving moment in the program.</p>
<p>After completing my second Urban Immersion program this summer, I think I gained a tremendous insight into how lucky I am for my health and for the health of my family, for my education, and for the food on my table and roof over my head. I have started to take notice of and be more grateful for the little things I used take for granted every day, before Urban Immersion. I learned that even if I cannot stop on the street and give someone money, that just looking in their direction and acknowledging them means the world to someone who is so often invisible.</p>
<p>I was moved by so many stories throughout the week at Urban Immersion. Two in particular stories moved me especially. Becca came to share her story with us as a young child who had experienced homelessness. Becca lost both her parents by age 15 and struggled with mental health throughout her life as she couch surfed her way through high school. To see the courage and strength that Becca had to move through the obstacles in her life with no support from parents is so inspiring. Now Becca has just been approved for section 8 housing and will continue to live in her own apartment.</p>
<p>Another story that moved me was Batman’s, Batman is a man I met while volunteering at Common Art last year and who I was delighted to see and talk to this year again. Common Art is a program where homeless men and women are invited to a church next to the Boston Common and urged to express themselves through art. Last year when I talked to Batman he did not have his own home and he was never quite sure where his next meal was coming from. This year Batman seemed to have had his spirits lifted, he told me he was due to get off a waiting list for subsidized housing and told me to “cross my fingers.” Batman and I talked for about an hour and a half and I found out that he used to be a camp counselor for a camp up in Maine. When I told him that this summer I would be a counselor in training for my own camp in Maine, his face lit up. It meant the world to me to make this connection with someone whose story is too often dismissed or unheard.</p>
<p>People often ask me what it’s like to be the “Jewish girl” at a primarily Catholic school. The Urban Immersion program is a perfect example of my answer. During Urban Immersion there was no religion; there was God. Urban Immersion may have been run through a Catholic school but it was rooted in the Jewish values I grew up learning at Temple Israel. Starting from barely eight years old I was given money every Sunday not to buy myself a bagel but to put it in the <em>Tzedakah</em> box for someone else. I became so passionate about social justice and community service through what I learned in my<em>Tzedakah </em>project before I became a Bat Mitzvah. It was then at the mere age of twelve that I began to want to change poverty and homelessness in the greater Boston area. My passion for the Urban Immersion program and all the work I put into it was a direct connection to my Jewish values and the values of the community of Temple Israel &#8211; a connection I felt both when performing direct service at a soup kitchen, and when advocating at the State House.</p>
<p>I recently heard someone tell me they were, in a way, against soup kitchens, because people don’t have to take a stance on them like they do with other kinds of social justice matters. This person told me that often other places of worship (not Temple Israel) don’t engage in the same social justice that we do because it’s too “political.” I in every way understand the point that the people who volunteer at soup kitchens are only providing a temporary fix &#8211; however, I disagree with the idea that this &#8220;temporary fix&#8221; is a mistake. Think of a human: a human needs two feet to walk; to balance. I think social justice has two feet, too. The first foot, I believe, is direct service, helping people survive the crisis they are currently in. The second foot is social change &#8211; removing the causes of a crisis through advocacy and empowerment. Social justice, like a human, needs both of these feet to balance, and although yes, a soup kitchen is only a temporary fix, it is ultimately just as important as social advocacy and the more “political” part of social change. This idea of the two feet of social justice was another key component in the Urban Immersion program.</p>
<p>It was an honor and privilege to have been able to help make the Urban Immersion the annual program it has become today. I feel humbled and grateful that I was able to achieve my goals of informing privileged girls the injustices that are occurring everyday around them. Urban Immersion really exemplifies the steps and importance of social justice. The actual direct service we do is the first step towards realizing the problems and injustices that we then advocate about on a State level. Urban Immersion may not be the reason Batman is given housing or a family finally gets above the poverty level but it is the reason that this year those nine girls have the same passion and drive to work towards social justice I do. This passion and that drive is what will raise minimum wages and get more families subsidized housing and food stamps, and their new-found awareness will make them all the more grateful for everything they have in their lives, this is what Urban Immersion will do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I pray for a ceasefire to this conflict, looking back on how it flared up, I am haunted by the facts. I am haunted by the reality of Israel’s vulnerability, haunted by the prospect of a world without a Jewish State.</p>
<p>I am haunted by the fact that Hamas continually launches missiles into Israel, targeting my people, my friends. I am haunted by the fact that Hamas’ leadership tactically dwells among civilians, using their children’s flesh as shields. I am a teacher, pained by the news that three Israeli children were brutally murdered, shot to death because of hatred.</p>
<p>I am a rabbi, shocked by the June 10th story by J.J. Goldberg contending that Prime Minister Netanyahu knew these children were murdered within hours of their death.</p>
<p>I am a parent, confused by the report of the Prime Minister’s subsequent gag order on reporting their deaths, a tactical play for a global campaign, at the expense of parents’ and people’s false hope.</p>
<p>I am a lover of Israel, befuddled by the mere possibility that this report, this story, may indeed be a fact.</p>
<p>I am not an unbiased, objective collector of facts.</p>
<p>I am a shareholder in the Jewish future.</p>
<p>The fact is: my gut aches as I pray for the safety of my people who are surrounded by enemies. Yet the fact is also: my conscience cries as I contemplate the unconscionable suffering in Gaza.</p>
<p>Last night I lay in bed, wide awake all night, the facts of this war colliding almost violently in my mind. This morning I lifted my body out of bed, the facts having tumbled and polished each other into questions:</p>
<p>How can we understand what is real or what is fabrication, without open, objective reporting?<br />
How can we know which plays, which tactics, warrant fervent advocacy, without trusting the very players who lead?<br />
Who is “being played” here?<br />
Who here is “playing along”?<br />
I am a Jew, a teacher, a rabbi, a parent, a lover of Israel, desperately trying to pray and live with an honest, truthful semblance of the facts.</p>
