<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nicky Campbell ready to surf at Stuart Beach.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The spunky woman eagerly paddling her surfboard in the ocean off Stuart Beach was once in a downward spiral.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I thought life was just as bad as it could possibly be,” Nicky Campbell says about the period of her husband’s illness and his death after 54 years of marriage. “Treasure Health Grief Support’s counseling services lifted me from the depths of despair, and I’m now enjoying some of the happiest days of my life.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More than 5,000 people a year take advantage of counseling services. Like Nicky, they find a place to reclaim their lives and, as she says, to develop a routine of happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For Nicky, working with counselor Karen Hirsch, LCSW, meant seeing the possibilities life has to offer, reaching out to others and finding something she loved to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Find something you can do every day to make you happy,” she remembers Karen telling her. &#8220;Do it in the morning. Get up and go out of the house.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nicky started going to the beach each morning, walking from Stuart Beach to the House of Refuge. She made friends with the lifeguards and the surfers along the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I made myself smile and say hello to everyone I met,” she says. “I started meeting young and happy people. The lifeguards were so friendly and taught me to bodysurf. Now I paddle with them five or six mornings a week!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over time she lost weight from her beach jaunts and got fitter than she had ever been in her life. At 76 years of age, she made the finals in the bodysurfing “Old Man of the Sea” contest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the Environmental Stewardship Awards in February, she was honored as the 2018 Outstanding Volunteer by Keep Martin Beautiful, nominated by the Martin County lifeguards for her consistent efforts to pick up litter on the beach and make our community a better place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Karen urged me to show gratitude for my life,” Nicky says. &#8220;She kept pointing me toward a future that I could direct.” After learning new skills from her lifeguard and surfer buddies, she can handle almost any day in the ocean and, thanks to counseling services at Treasure Health, “any day on land or sea.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://treasurehealth.org/service/grief-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grief support</a> services are available to all who grieve in Martin and St. Lucie counties, thanks to generous grants and community contributions to the <a href="https://treasurehealth.org/about-us/the-treasure-health-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treasure Coast Hospice Foundation</a>.

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Photo and article by MaryAnn Ketcham.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pets are loyal companions, cherished family members and confidants. Their love knows no boundaries, and with a look, snuggles or a quirky dance, they bring comfort even on the worst of days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reliance between a pet and its owner is mutual; best friendships work that way. So, when a pet owner enters hospice and can no longer tend to his ie her pet’s needs, it causes anxiety and distress.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Treasured Pets, a program offered through Treasure Health’s Treasure Coast Hospice service,  helps alleviate some of that concern. Volunteers, donors and partner veterinarians are the lifeblood of this endeavor that helps care for and maintain the pets’ routine and general health while its owner travels the hospice journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Typically, trained volunteers deliver pet food, play with and walk the pets and transport them to and from their groomers and veterinarians.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the country celebrated National Pet Day on April 11, compassionate volunteers Diana Traegler and Sharon Brown, together with Volunteer Manager Deborah Kotrady and Vice President of Human Resources Angella Williams marked the occasion by visiting the doctors and staff of the Treasured Pets’ partner veterinarians.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Presenting certificates of appreciation, balloons and a bag full of goodies, they graciously thanked and praised the 13 vets for their commitment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“This program is one of the best things out there,” said Port Salerno Animal Hospital’s Jason White, DVM.“Pets are most in need when families can’t care for them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Offering preferential scheduling for shots, emergency treatments and assisting with pet placement should the hospice patient pass are but a few examples of the kindnesses displayed by all participating vets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Everyone at Morningside Animal Hospital is truly honored to be a part of this pet care program,” Dr. Jennifer DiTrapani said. “It is our pleasure to do our part in helping to ease the families’ minds during difficult times.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Treasured Pets is funded by individual donations and by the Pegasus Foundation’s Help Us Help Them project.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Volunteer Diana Traegler offers this perspective about the Treasured Pets endeavor: “Taking care of the pets IS taking care of the hospice patient.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To become a partner, please call <a href="tel:7724034500">772 403-4500</a> or visit <a href="https://treasurehealth.org/ways-to-give/volunteer">treasurehealth.org/ways-to-give/volunteer</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">“I am honored to be recognized by the NASW Florida Treasure Coast Unit,” said Nardone. “I am extremely proud to be part of such a compassionate profession whose mission is to serve people by helping them to solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives such as trauma, loss and grief. I truly believe that we all have the responsibility to make a difference in our world; we have to be the good. It is this belief that motivates me every day.”</p>

Today, Nardone leads the grief support program, overseeing a team of 10 counselors who are available to the community for both individual and group counseling sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nardone graduated from The University of Central Florida with a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work and received her Master’s Degree of Social Work from Barry University.

					<p>STUART, Fla. (February 21, 2018) &#8211; Almost 300 revelers came together for a night of dinner, dancing and intrigue at the Midnight Masquerade at Mariner Sands Country Club in Stuart.  The event raised $90,000 for the Treasure Coast Hospice Foundation in support of Treasure Health’s specialized pediatric care program, Little Treasures, which focuses on the unique needs of children facing serious illness.</p>
<p>Amid a flurry of fanciful masks, participants heard about the lives touched by the Little Treasures’ program. Oralea Marquardt, the mother of William Marquardt, was the keynote speaker.  William received hospice care for seven years beginning in 2007 after he was diagnosed with Gm1 gangliosidosis. Oralea shared how Treasure Health’s pediatric care program provided her son and the entire family with support and guidance to help William live his life to the fullest until his death at the age of eight and a half in 2014.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Brian Mast made a visit to the event, aiding the Little Treasures program by offering “A Day with a Congressman” for the live auction. The event also featured a silent auction, a best dressed/mask contest and music from The Incredible Johnny L.</p>
<p>Agnes Palmer, Treasure Health development officer, said “We are blessed to have Event Chair Charity Parsons and her wonderful committee of dedicated volunteers. The success of this event reflects their hard work as well as the generosity of many donors in our community who support Treasure Health’s pediatric program, which provides individualized palliative and hospice care to children with serious illness.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">STUART, Fla. (November 17, 2017) &#8211; Treasure Health will hold its annual Tree of Life celebrations in December, giving the community an opportunity to come together to honor loved ones during the holiday season. The seasonal celebrations will be held in Stuart on Wednesday, Dec. 6; Fort Pierce on Thursday, Dec. 7; and Port St. Lucie on Monday, Dec. 18 at 6 p.m.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The annual events are held in partnership with the City of Stuart, City of Fort Pierce, and Town of Tradition.  Locations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stuart:</strong> Downtown Gazebo at 100 E. Ocean Ave.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fort Pierce:</strong> Downtown Gazebo at the corner of Avenue A/Indian River Dr.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Port St. Lucie:</strong> Tradition Lakeside Gazebo, SW Meeting St.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The celebrations will include an inspirational message of hope from Treasure Health and live holiday music by local school choirs. Attendees can also purchase a porcelain keepsake ornament engraved with the words “Forever in our Hearts” for $15 to support Treasure Health Grief Support services in Martin and St. Lucie counties.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“The holidays can be challenging for some who have experienced the loss of a loved one,” said Jacki Nardone, Treasure Health Grief Support Director of Counseling and Pediatric Services. “The Tree of Life events provide an opportunity to acknowledge and express those feelings while being surrounded by a supportive group of people who have experienced a similar loss.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Guests at all of the Tree of Life celebrations may acknowledge their loss by writing the names of their loved ones on a special memory tag that is placed on the decorated tree. For those who are unable to attend their local ceremony, memory tags may be picked up at the Mayes Center or the Thomas Counseling Center and hung on any of the trees at their convenience. The trees will be displayed in the downtown gazebos throughout the holiday season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Treasure Coast Hospice </strong><strong>Foundation’s </strong><strong>Memory Walk to be held Saturday, Nov. 18</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">FT PIERCE, Fla. (October 26, 2017) – Join us in a walk for remembrance and healing at Treasure Coast Hospice Foundation’s 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Beach Stroll followed by a buffet breakfast, sponsored by Archie’s Seabreeze in Fort Pierce. Proceeds benefit Treasure Health Grief Support programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After a pre-walk warm up at Archie’s, strollers will be able to walk a one-mile route along the beachside before returning to the popular outdoor venue for breakfast.  This walk is an opportunity for individuals and families to honor loved ones and the grieving in our community as they go through their journey of healing. All strollers and participants are encouraged to bring a photo of their loved one to put on the memory wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other opportunities for event attendees include purchasing and decorating luminaries for $10 to be displayed in the breakfast area, memorial signs for $15 to be placed along the path and hummingbird wind spinners for $25, which can be brought home as a lasting memorial. There will also be a rock painting station, sponsored by True Crew Dance Company, where participants of all ages can paint a rock in memory of a loved one and place it along the path or take it home. During the breakfast, there will be an opportunity to learn more about Treasure Health Grief Support, mingle with friends and purchase tickets to win great items in a fun raffle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“The Beach Stroll is a community-oriented event where all ages can participate,” said Jacki Nardone, Director of Counseling and Pediatric Services. “Because of fundraisers like this, we are able and continue to offer comfort and support services to those who have experienced the loss of a loved one.”</p>
