		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The UUFN Green Sanctuary Committee will coordinate this year&#8217;s program at UUFN. Look for the collection of &#8220;Small Change to Create Big Change&#8221; starting on October 29th at Trunk or Treat. There will also be a fundraising event for this program on November 12th during Coffee Hour. The people of the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea are certainly facing big change. They are among the first communities on earth having to relocate because of climate change.  UUSC is supporting migration with dignity for the Carteret Islanders facing severe climate change impacts they did nothing to create. Learn more about this program of the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee. [&#8230;]]]></description>
