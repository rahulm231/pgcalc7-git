<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., November 21, 2016—At the annual meeting of the American Musicological Society on Nov. 5 in Vancouver, Canada, Williams College Professor of Music W. Anthony Sheppard received the H. Colin Slim Award for his article &#8220;Puccini and the Music Boxes,&#8221; which appeared in the <em>Journal of the Royal Musical Association</em> in spring 2015. He was also named Series Editor for the prestigious <em>AMS Studies in Music</em> book series published by Oxford University Press.</p>
<p>The H. Colin Slim Award honors each year a musicological article of exceptional merit, published during the previous year in any language and in any country by a scholar who is past the early stages of her or his career. Sheppard&#8217;s article was selected for open access publication and is available at: <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02690403.2015.1008863">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02690403.2015.1008863</a></p>
<p>Sheppard is the first scholar at a liberal arts college to receive this award.  In 2002 he received the AMS Alfred Einstein Award for best article published by a scholar in the early stages of his or her career.</p>

<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., November 15, 2016—The annual Christmas Service of Lessons and Carols at Williams College will be held at 4 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 10 and 11, in Thompson Memorial Chapel. The identical services feature choral music by the Williams Concert and Chamber Choirs, congregational singing of carols, and the traditional reading of the biblical Christmas story.</p>
<p><a href="http://communications.williams.edu/files/LessonsCarols.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-11244" src="http://communications.williams.edu/files/LessonsCarols-300x224.jpg" alt="lessonscarols" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://communications.williams.edu/files/LessonsCarols-300x224.jpg 300w, http://communications.williams.edu/files/LessonsCarols-100x75.jpg 100w, http://communications.williams.edu/files/LessonsCarols.jpg 589w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></a>There is no admission charge for the services, but all are encouraged to bring an item of non-perishable canned or packaged food for local emergency food pantries.</p>
<p>The Williams Concert and Chamber Choirs will perform under the direction of Brad Wells, director of choral/vocal activities. This year the Choirs will be joined by harpist Anna DeLoi ’18 in offering several movements from Benjamin Britten’s much-loved cantata, “A Ceremony of Carols” as well as music arranged for the occasion by Mr. Wells. As always, the congregation will have the opportunity to join in singing many beloved traditional carols. Organist Edwin Lawrence will accompany the service—which begins with a prelude at 3:40 p.m.</p>
<p>Students, faculty, and staff from the college as well as members of the local community will read the traditional “lessons” derived from the biblical Christmas story. The Rev. Rick Spalding, Chaplain to the College, will deliver a meditation, and Fr. Gary Caster, Catholic Chaplain, will serve at liturgist. As always, a free-will offering of money will be received at the conclusion of each service in support of local and international charities.</p>
<p>The service, which is modeled on the traditional Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols first held on Christmas Eve in 1918 at King’s College Chapel in Cambridge, England, has been described as one that “presents the Christmas story in an ambiance of mystery, splendor, hope, and joy.” The Service of Lessons and Carols has been a beloved holiday tradition at Williams since the 1960’s.</p>

<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., November 8, 2016—Joanna Klink, 2016-17 Margaret Bundy Scott Professor of English at Williams College, will read from her works of poetry on Thursday, Nov. 17. The event will take place at 7 p.m. in the Weston Hall Presentation Room. It is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Klink earned an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and a Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins University. Her collections of poetry include <em>They Are Sleeping </em>(2000), <em>Circadian </em>(2007), <em>Raptus </em>(2010), and <em>Excerpts from a Secret Prophecy</em> (2015). Her work has been included in numerous anthologies, including <em>The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry </em>(2011).</p>
<p>“In poems I am trying to find my bearings through a world that at times feels remote and inchoate and struck blank with noise,” Klink has said of her work. “I would like to place myself in a field of deep attention, and out of that attention come to feel and regard with more acute understanding what is there. I write to be less hopelessly myself, to sense something more expansive than where I speak from.”</p>
<p>Klink’s honors and awards include a Rona Jaffe Writer&#8217;s Award and an Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She was the Briggs-Copeland Poet at Harvard University and currently teaches in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Montana.</p>

<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., November 8, 2016—Priscilla McCutcheon, assistant professor of geography and geosciences at the University of Louisville, specializing in human geography, food, and race, will visit Williams College on Tuesday, Nov. 15, to discuss &#8220;Growing Black Food on Sacred Land: Using Black Liberation Theology to Imagine an Alternative Black Agrarian Future.&#8221; This event will take place at 7:30 p.m. in Griffin Hall, room 3. It is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>McCutcheon’s primary research focus is on the intersection of agriculture/food, racial identity formation, and religion. In her dissertation, “‘Heaven on Earth’: Race, Food and Space in Black Religious Food Programs,” she examines racial identity formation and place-making through the lens of three black religious food programs that range from a black Protestant church’s emergency food program to a black nationalist Christian organization that is farming over 4,000 acres of land.</p>
<p>McCutcheon has previously held positions at the University of Illinois, Chicago, where she was a post-doctoral fellow, and the University of Connecticut, where she was an assistant professor. She holds a B.A. from Spelman College and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>This event is sponsored by Africana Studies and the Center for Environmental Studies and part of the year long initiative on Confronting Climate Change. Throughout this academic year the college will host a series of speakers, events, and programming planned to shed light on the issue of climate change and how we should respond to it as individuals, as an institution, as a nation, and as a member of the global community.</p>

		<title>Class of 1966 Environmental Center Meets Six of Seven Criteria for Living Building Challenge</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media contact: Noelle Lemoine, communications assistant; tele: (413) 597-4277; email: <a href="mailto:nlemoine@williams.edu">Noelle.Lemoine@williams.edu</a></p>
<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., November 3, 2016—A year after starting its pursuit of the world’s most rigorous sustainability certification for its new environmental center, Williams College has come up short on one of the key performance measures: net-zero energy use.</p>
<p>Twelve months of consecutive data show that the center has qualified in six of the seven environmental performance criteria for the Living Building Challenge (LBC), but without the energy standard it won’t meet the standard necessary for full certification as a Living Building.</p>
<p>“We knew when we started that the Living Building Challenge is just that—a real challenge—and that it would take time, experimentation, and ongoing learning to achieve full certification,” said Amy Johns ’98, director of the Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives. “What we have learned can be passed on to the community and to those who come after us in pursuit of the LBC, and that’s what makes this building a valuable place for teaching.”</p>
<p>The LBC program, administered by the International Living Future Institute, is the most stringent measure of sustainability in the built environment. It certifies buildings that have positive, regenerative environmental and community efforts. To meet the challenge, a building must demonstrate that it can live within its means, using only the electricity produced and water collected on-site and devoting 35 percent of its landscaping to food production.</p>
<p>Twenty imperatives determine ambitious goals in seven areas, known as petals: energy, water, materials, site, health, equity, and beauty. To date, only 11 buildings in the world have received full LBC certification.</p>
<p>With the center currently consuming more energy than it is producing, staff will continue collecting data until it can log 12 consecutive months of being net-zero (or better) for energy and apply for full certification. In the meantime, it will apply for partial certification, recognizing the community’s significant accomplishments in all of the other areas. The International Living Future Institute announces its certifications annually in May, during its annual conference.</p>
<p>Consultants who have worked on other LBC buildings are reviewing energy consumption and generation for the building and will help explore ways to improve both, said Mike Evans, assistant director of the Zilkha Center, which shares the building with the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). The consultants will conduct full assessments of the photovoltaic production and the original building modeling against performance consumption. They also will verify that the heat pump operations are in line with best practices.</p>
<p>Sitting in the heart of campus, the environmental center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition to office space for the Zilkha Center and CES, the building includes study areas, meeting and classroom space, and a kitchen that students may use to prepare and cook meals.</p>
<p>“The purpose of the building is to live in it and learn from it,” says Ralph Bradburd, CES chair and the David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy. “The learning justifies the time, effort, and money we put into it.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media contact: Noelle Lemoine, communications assistant; tele: (413) 597-4277; email: <a href="mailto:nlemoine@williams.edu">Noelle.Lemoine@williams.edu</a></p>
<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., October 31, 2016—Charlie Doret, assistant professor of physics, will give two Sigma Xi lectures at Williams College on Thursday, Nov. 10 and Friday, Nov. 11. Both lectures will take place at 4:15 p.m. in Wege Auditorium, and will be followed by a catered reception. They are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Doret’s first talk is titled “Atoms at Work: Quantum Mechanics, Qubits, and Quool Tools for Research and Technology.” He will discuss how, as our understanding of quantum physics has grown, improvements in technology have increasingly allowed us to see atoms not just as objects to study but as tools with many potential applications. Atoms are increasingly important in new technologies, some of which Doret will present and discuss.</p>
<p>In his second lecture, Doret will present “Quantum Simulation with Trapped Calcium Ions.” Improvements in coherent control over the quantum states of physical systems have given rise to many applications ranging from metrology to quantum information processing. After a broad overview, Doret will discuss ongoing efforts at Williams to build a trapped-ion quantum simulator and describe application of such a simulator to the study of thermal conductivity in nano-scale systems.</p>
<p>Doret received his bachelor&#8217;s degree from Williams in 2002, followed by a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard. From 2010-2013, he completed postdoctoral research on quantum information processing with trapped ions at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta, Ga.  After a year teaching at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., Doret returned to Williams to begin an assistant professorship. An experimental atomic physicist, Doret’s research in quantum simulation involves using atomic ions trapped with electromagnetic fields to emulate the behavior of other physical systems.</p>
<p>Sigma Xi is a national society honoring and encouraging research in science since 1886. The Williams chapter was founded in 1969. It recognizes exceptional graduating students in the sciences each year. The Sigma Xi lecture is a semi-annual event.</p>

<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., October 26, 2016—On Thursday, Nov. 10, Jennifer Granholm, former Democratic governor of Michigan, and Scott Brown, former Republican senator from Massachusetts, will discuss the 2016 Presidential Election, &#8220;Post Mortem: What&#8217;s Next?&#8221; at Williams College at 8 p.m. on the MainStage of the &#8217;62 Center for Theatre and Dance<strong><em>. </em></strong>Justin Crowe, associate professor of political science and chair of leadership studies, will moderate. The event is free and open to the public. Tickets can be reserved in advance online (62center.williams.edu) or by phone (413-597-2425) Tuesday through Saturday, 1-5 p.m. Tickets are also available at the door.</p>
<p>The discussion will both debrief the 2016 campaign and look forward to what we can and should expect in American politics in 2017 and beyond. What were the turning points in the election? How do we make sense of the messages that voters are sending to their elected officials? What can we expect to see in the months after the new president is inaugurated? How might the House and Senate work differently given their partisan compositions? How might the Democratic and Republican parties adapt or evolve in response to the election results? How does the country move forward following a bitterly divisive campaign season?</p>
<p>Elected Michigan&#8217;s first female governor in 2002, Granholm is credited with transforming Michigan&#8217;s economy in the midst of steady decline. Four years later, she was re-elected with the largest number of votes ever cast for governor in the state. During her two terms as governor, Granholm, who previously served as Michigan’s Attorney General, pioneered clean energy policies, signed into law a college prep curriculum for every high school student in the state, and launched the No Worker Left Behind program to provide job training to displaced Michigan employees. Since leaving the governor’s office, she has taught law and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley; an advisor to and advocate for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, she has also agreed to serve as co-chair of Clinton’s transition team.</p>
<p>Brown served three terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and two terms in the state Senate. In 2010, Brown won the U.S. Senate seat that had become vacant upon the death of Ted Kennedy, making him the first Republican to represent the state in the Senate in more than three decades. Serving in the Senate until 2013, Brown developed a reputation as one of the most bipartisan members of the chamber and played an important role in both the Hire A Hero Act (providing tax benefits for employers that hire returning veterans) and the STOCK Act (prohibiting insider trading for members of Congress). Upon leaving the Senate, Brown, who recently concluded 35 years of service in the Army National Guard, has remained active in politics, running for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, campaigning with Republican congressional candidates, and serving as surrogate for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The Leadership Studies program is sponsoring the event as part of the James MacGregor Burns Memorial Lecture Series.</p>

<p>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., October 25, 2016—The new documentary film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q82X6Pr0Of8"><em>The Age of Consequences</em> </a>will be screened at Williams College on Friday, Nov. 4, at 7 p.m. in Wege Auditorium in the Thompson Chemistry building. It is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The documentary investigates the impacts of climate change on increased resource scarcity, migration, and conflict through the lens of US national security and global stability. The perspectives of admirals, generals and military veterans take us beyond the headlines of the conflict in Syria, the social unrest of the Arab Spring, the rise of radicalized groups like ISIS, and the European refugee crisis and show how climate change stressors interact with societal tensions, sparking conflict. Whether a long-term vulnerability or sudden shock, the film explains how water and food shortages, drought, extreme weather, and sea-level rise function as “accelerants of instability” and “catalysts for conflict” in volatile regions of the world.</p>
<p>The Pentagon insiders featured in the film make the compelling case that if we go on with business as usual, the consequences of climate change—waves of refugees, failed states, terrorism—will continue to grow in scale and frequency, with grave implications for peace and security in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The filmmakers include Jared P. Scott, writer, director, and producer; Sophie Robinson ’11, executive producer and director of outreach; Kelly Nyks, producer; Mike McSweeney, director of photography; Hypatia A. Porter, editor and associate producer; Malcolm Francis, composer; John Picklap, post-production coordinator and assistant editor; and Dave Regos, research coordinator and assistant editor.</p>
<p>This event is sponsored by the environmental studies department and is part of the year-long initiative Confronting Climate Change. Throughout this academic year the college will host a series of speakers, events, and programming planned to shed light on the issue of climate change and how we should respond to it as individuals, as an institution, as a nation, and as a member of the global community.</p>
